Graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., CS 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes).Check your registration to ensure you meet the restrictions on registration of CS classes.MS and PhD Degree RequirementsMaster of Science (MS) in Computer ScienceThe Master of Science program is designed for students who have received their undergraduate degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and wish to develop greater depth and/or breadth in computer science. The MS degree prepares students for more challenging–and often more highly-compensated–work in their professional careers. UIC Computer Science MS alumni have traditionally been well-positioned for interesting and rewarding careers.MS degree could be completed with a Coursework, Project or Thesis Option. Full-time, well-prepared, highly motivated students may complete the program in as few as three semesters; most students complete the program in four to six semesters of residence.Detailed MS degree requirements are published below: Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer ScienceThe Doctor of Philosophy program is designed for students who have received their MS degrees in Computer Science (or closely related fields), and who wish to develop greater depth and breadth in computer science, with particular emphasis on the development of expertise in Computer Science research. The PhD degree prepares students for the most challenging–and often most highly-compensated–work in the field of Computer Science. Typically, PhD graduates are employed in commercial or industrial research, or themselves become faculty members in Computer Science departments throughout the world.Exceptional applicants who have completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, or a related field, and wish to pursue a PhD will be considered for a “Direct PhD Admission”. Such students will pursue the PhD degree without the requirement or option of first completing a Master degree.Detailed PhD degree requirements are published below: Previous CS Graduate Program Requirements Manuals (Refer to year you started your program)Student Forms & Links - for use by current CS graduate students only.Financial Aid InformationFinancial Aid InformationDepartment financial aid is available in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, research assistantships and tuition fee waivers. Students on good standing as defined by the department standards can be nominated and/or awarded any type of aid. FellowshipsVarious fellowships are available through the Graduate College and outside foundations.  Students and faculty are notified periodically of these fellowships and deadlines.  Fellowships available through outside foundations may require students to be Permanent Residents or citizens of the US.  Consult the ‘Funding your Education’ section of the graduate college website () for awards available through the graduate college and general information on the fellowships and funding..Fellowships available through the Graduate College are awarded in recognition of scholarly achievement and promise.  They enable students to pursue graduate studies and research without a service requirement.  The stipends vary by fellowships and unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fellows supported by the Graduate College (i.e., University Fellowships, Dean’s Scholar, Abraham Lincoln, DFI (formerly IMGIP/ICEOP) carry a tuition and fee waiver. (Check with your home department for details).  Some fellowships allow recipients to accept additional funding, recipients should consult the terms of the award for details.Dean’s Scholar Award and Chancellor’s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program are the two most prestigious awards provided by the Graduate College.  These are described on the Graduate College website as follows:Dean’s Scholar Award: The Dean’s Scholar Award is a one-year, non-renewable award presented by the Dean of the Graduate College in recognition of a student’s scholarly achievement. It is intended to provide the most distinguished, advanced-level graduate students with a period of time dedicated solely to the completion of their programs.  The Dean’s Scholar competition is open to doctoral students who have passed the Graduate College required Preliminary Examination at the University of Illinois at Chicago and are well into their dissertation work. Application Procedures:  Deadlines for UIC fellowships and other awards administered through the Graduate College are established jointly by the Awards Committee of the Graduate College and the Graduate College.  Since departments need to submit nominations to the Graduate College (wherever it states “department nominations due”), complete application is due to the CS Student Affairs office at least 5-7 days prior to the Graduate College deadline.  Recommendation letters should be in electronic format and submitted directly by the recommender to the CS Student Affairs office ().Non UIC fellowships have their own submission rules. Students should contact the CS Student Affairs office for any questions upon announcement of the fellowships.Upon announcement of the deadlines for the fellowships offered by the graduate college, students interested in applying should talk to their advisor first and with consultation must submit an Application for Graduate Appointment, statement of purpose, resume with publications and three recommendation letters (one from advisor) to the CS Student Affairs Office.  The Director of Graduate Studies will select from among the applicants and submit nominations for consideration by the Graduate College Awards Committee, which makes the final recommendation to the Dean.Chancellor’s Supplemental Graduate Research Fellowship Program: This program supports increased multidisciplinary scholarship opportunities and exposure to careers in research and creative fields for graduate and professional students. Successful applicants must show exceptional promise for future multidisciplinary research and creative activity in their fields of interest.  Funding will allow graduate or professional candidates to supplement existing stipends with a 0% fellowship appointment for the fellowship period. Applications will be evaluated not only on the quality of the prospective student, but also the quality of the proposed project and mentored experience. A faculty mentor will direct the project but it is expected that the student will play the major role in the writing of this application.  Consult the graduate college web site for details on the program and application procedure.  Teaching Assistantships for Continuing StudentsTeaching Assistantships (TA’s) are awarded to students with outstanding academic records.  TA’s assist in the teaching and grading of CS course work under the direction of the course instructor.  The assistantship includes a monthly stipend and waiver of tuition and fees.  Details of waiver are available at , stipends for Computer Science students are higher than minimum specified.Amount: Current monthly stipend is approximately $2,084 ($2,145 for students who passed the PhD qualifier) and a tuition and fee waiver. The stipend is subject to change, all fees are not covered by the waiver. Eligibility: Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply.  Graduates of foreign institutions should have the Oral Certification from the ITA office.  These are the minimum requirements for TA eligibility; many factors determine the offers of TA positions. Application Procedure: Decisions for the following academic year (fall and spring semesters) are made during the Summer.  Students must complete and submit the online application when it is open.  Students are notified via UIC email when the application is open.  TA positions are generally assigned for the academic year (fall and spring); thus very few TA positions are available for the spring semesters.  Applications for Spring semester are available in December.Registration Requirement: At least 8 hours in Fall and Spring. Students are not required need to register in Summer, but must register for at least 3 hours to receive the tuition and service fee waiver.English Proficiency: Illinois State Law requires all international teaching assistants providing instruction in classroom, discussion group, laboratory, or office hour situations to be certified proficient in speaking and communicating in English. The CS Department requires ALL graduate students appointed as Graduate Teaching Assistants pass the Oral Certification administered by the International Teaching Assistant Program.  Graduate students who received their undergraduate degree in the United States or from a country in which the primary language is English are not required to receive the Certification.  Information on the ITA program can be obtained from.  Tuition and Fee WaiverA limited number of tuition and fee waivers are available to the department through Graduate College. These awards provide an exemption from tuition fee, service fee, health service fee, AFMFA, LITA and partial cost of  Campus Care health insurance (Fall & Spring only).  Students must be registered for 12 hours of study during the entire semester in which they receive the waiver.  A student who drops below the 12 hour requirement at any time in the semester will be responsible for all tuition and service fees. Eligibility: Students should be on good standing as defined by the CS department to be eligible to apply.Application Procedure: Decisions for the Fall semester are made during the Summer.  Students must complete and submit the online completed application when it is open.  Students are contacted via UIC email when the application is open.  Applications for the Spring semester are available in December.Registration Requirement:  At least 12 hours in Fall and Spring and 6 hours in Summer. Research AssistantshipsStudents are encouraged to contact faculty members with shared research interests directly. The faculty member, depending on the availability of grant money determines the term and eligibility requirements of the appointment.CS Graduate Student ProcessesCS Graduate Student ProcessesCourse SelectionAll graduate students should select classes independently in their area of interest.  PhD students should consult their faculty advisor for course recommendations. A maximum of 8 hours of non-CS graduate courses may be counted toward the overall course work requirement. However, prior formal approval via petition is required. Consult CS Student Affairs office for details on submitting a petition.  New students should note that courses taken and grades obtained in their first semester of enrollment largely determine financial aid awards for the following academic year.Unless specifically advised otherwise, new graduate students should not enroll in the following courses for their first semester: CS 597 Project Research; CS 598 MS Thesis Research; or CS 599 PhD Thesis Research.  Students should take regularly scheduled courses during their first semester. Registration Restrictions* – CS graduate students may not register for more than 12 credit hours of CS didactic classes (i.e., 400-491 and CS 500-594 classes). Anyone in violation of the registration policy can be removed from courses by the department until their credit hours of didactic classes no longer exceeds the limit for that semester. In addition, students violating this policy may also be restricted from future registration until until they have met with the DGS. How is it implemented?The Department will do random checks on graduate student registration.Graduate students registered for over 3 graduate CS didactic classes (at anytime in the registration cycle) will be emailed with a warning that they are exceeding the limit and given ample time to correct their registration; or receive permission to stay in class by discussing this matter with the DGS or Director of CS Student Affairs.Once the deadline is passed, if a student has not corrected their registration or received permission to stay – a hold will be placed on their account which prevents further registration of any kind (both add / drop).The Department will then decide which classes to drop and ask UIC registrar’s office to drop the class(es) from the student’s schedule.Any exemption have to be cleared by the DGS or the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905).  We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs.*The department may implement new temporary restrictions as needed. Other course processesSome 400 level courses in the MCS department overlap with CS lower level courses. Graduate credit in CS is not allowed for such courses. For example, graduate credit is not allowed for MCS 441 Theory of Computation, which is the same as CS 301 (Languages and Automata). Courses in IDS are generally not allowed to count towards graduation.  If you are uncertain, please check with the CS Student Affairs Office, the DGS and/or your faculty advisor prior to registering for the course.Students who receive any form of financial aid from the University (TA, RA, Fellowship or Tuition & Fee Waiver) are subject to minimum registration requirements, which must be maintained throughout the semester.  See graduate college website for requirements with assistantships:.  Students who have been awarded a Fellowship or TFW must be registered for a minimum of 12 hours in Fall and Spring semester; and 6 hours in Summer.  Note: If you fall below the required hours at any point in the semester, you become ineligible for the tuition waiver and will be assessed all fees.The department requires all students supported by a TA position to register for a minimum of 8 credit hours of coursework each semester (except Summer), until they have completed the required coursework.  Upon completion of the coursework you can follow the graduate college registration requirements for the appropriate percentage appointment. These minimum hours are the requirement for a student to be considered as full-time. Students supported on fellowships or tuition and fee waivers are already required to have a minimum of 12 credit hours of registration in regular semesters and a minimum of 6 credit hours in summer. Students who need to complete prerequisites should register for additional courses to achieve a 12-hour registration. Students working on MS project, MS thesis or PhD dissertations should register for CS 597, CS 598 or CS 599 hours, respectively. Course PrerequisitesIf your undergraduate degree is not from UIC, please make sure that your course background is equivalent to the recommended course prerequisites. Talk to the instructor of the course if you have any concerns about prerequisites. You are responsible for the course prerequisites, not your instructor. You will not be allowed to withdraw from a course after the drop deadline because you have not met the prerequisites. The drop deadline is 10th day of classes for Fall & Spring and 5th day for Summer terms. This drop deadline is strictly enforced for all courses. Adding/Dropping/Withdrawing CoursesStudents should finalize their class schedule by the end of the add/drop period (10th day for Fall & Spring, 5th day for Summer terms).  Once the add/drop period has ended, students are not allowed to add/drop classes.Any requests to add/withdraw from a class after the add/drop period must be petitioned, with support from instructor (not advisor) of the class.  Submit the petition to the CS Student Affairs Office (SEO 905) along with all supporting documentation for the DGS to review.As a general policy, you will not be permitted to withdraw from courses (particularly the 300 and 400 level courses in CS).  If permission (from the Director of Graduate Studies) is granted for such a “late drop”, it will be reported as a withdrawal (W) on the transcript.  A “W” cannot be stricken from your permanent record and cannot be replaced by a new grade should you retake the course and obtain a letter grade.The following are examples of unacceptable reasons for dropping a course after the deadline: “I have had this material before”, “This course will not be useful to me”, “I am taking too many courses”, “I do not have the prerequisites”, “I forgot to drop the course before the drop deadline”, “A bad grade will affect my GPA negatively” or “I have not attended classes for the past few weeks”.  It is your responsibility to make sure that you enroll in classes that are appropriate for your academic course load, schedule and that you have met all prerequisites.Students holding fellowships, assistantships, tuition and fee waivers, and student visas must maintain the required number of credit hours or risk loss of their aid for the term. Students whose waivers are revoked due to insufficient credit hours will be billed the full cost of tuition, fees and any late charges that may apply.Students are allowed to register for a maximum total of 20 hours per semester. Note: students must remain compliance with the CS departments registration policy for graduate students.  In order to register for more than 20 hours, the student must have approval from his/her advisor and submit that information to SEO 905 for override permission. Good Academic StandingIn addition to the Graduate college defined good standing satus (), Computer Science graduate students should not be in violation of any conduct policies or academic dishonesty. GradesCoursework earn grades of A, B, C, D or F; research hours a ‘S’ or ‘U’.  GPA is calculated based on the grades and credits hours.  For details see:. Probation and Academic DismissalAll graduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 (B) grade point average (GPA).  The GPA calculation does not include independent study and research courses (CS 590, CS 595-599).Graduate course work must be satisfied by a C grade or higher.  If a student’s graduate GPA falls below 3.0 (B), the Graduate College will issue a letter of warning and impose academic probation for a specified period of time.  Failure to comply with the terms will likely result in dismissal from the CS program and Graduate College.  Details of this available at:.A student on probation is ineligible for department awarded financial aid, recommendation for any type of practical training, or graduation.Other Graduate ProgramsJoint MS program with Politecnico Di MilanoInstructional Computing FacilitiesInstructional Computing FacilitiesThe Computer Science Department maintains an instructional computing facility and remote servers, which serve its students’ computing needs for CS coursework. Student Access:Each new student is assigned a CS account which expires one year after graduation.
