          LIB IDEA Commons        





Accessible: YesReservable: NoProjector: NoPrinters: 3Seats: 80Lab access: Features
IDEA (Information Data Expertise Access) Commons is a special place, conceived in 2006 and realized in Fall 2011.  Located at the south end of the first floor of the Richard J. Daley Library, the IDEA Commons is designed to help students use technology and library research materials to complete their academic work.  There are areas for research, presentations, group study, tutoring, reference consultations, and socializing.  By integrating information resources, technology and expertise, the IDEA Commons will maximize the learning and social environment for UIC students. The Library and ACCC are partners in providing these services and opportunities to students.  Note the 24 hour availability of this space in the Schedule. 
IDEA Commons is home to a large dividable classroom (a 40-computer space which can be halved into 2 20-seat classrooms).  Each side of the room has a projector and two projection screens.  When not in use for classes or seminars, this space is available for general use.  Check the schedule, posted at the room's entrance, before entering.  Reservation inquiries should be directed to the Reference Librarians.  
 is also located within the IDEA Commons. The ACCC lab monitor is stationed in the IDEA Commons, along with the Daley Library Reference Librarians.  Both are seated at the service desk (lab monitors are closest to the exit door). When two lab monitors are present, one is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the 9 printers located throughout the Daley Library.
