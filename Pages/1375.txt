Cost of Attendance (COA)




Cost of Attendance (COA)
SFAS award letters list anticipated expenses which reflect the Cost of Attendance (COA) students may encounter during the academic year. The total COA is an estimate, not a bill, and actual costs may vary. Examples of Cost of Attendance can be viewed below.




Direct vs Indirect Costs

Direct Costs are paid to the university bill and include tuition and differential, fees, and room and board for students living on campus.
Indirect Costs are anticipated expenses students may incur. These costs include books and supplies, travel, and miscellaneous personal expenses. Room and board are indirect costs for students living off campus.
