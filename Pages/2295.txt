Transfers





 

Transfer to UIC


Your prospective academic department at UIC must complete and submit a DS-2019 Request Form, this form contains a Transfer section for you to complete on the last page of the Applicant portion of the request. This application will require you to provide: 

Copies of your passport, J-1 entry visa, Form I-94 and current DS-2019(s)
Complete contact information for your current international/J-1 advisor.

Once we have complete information, we will correspond with your current sponsoring institution to process the transfer of J-1 sponsorship.
Please allow at least three weeks for the transfer process. Do not make arrangements to begin at UIC until you have been contacted to schedule your check-in appointment with OIS.  
One must be in the U.S. to transfer; do not make plans to travel internationally during the transition from your current sponsor to UIC.
You will not receive your UIC DS-2019 before you check-in with OIS, which will be on or after the “SEVIS Transfer Release Date” requested.  
OIS will contact your UIC academic department when your transfer has been approved and complete. You may then come to OIS to check-in, collect your new Form(s) DS-2019, and (if appropriate) receive authorization for employment at UIC. As noted in the form, you must present valid J-1 insurance upon check-in.

 

Transfer from UIC 


Complete a J-1 Transfer Out Form. This form will require you to provide: 

Complete contact information for your prospective international/J-1 advisor.
A start date that is at least three weeks in advance of submission of this form to OIS.

Once we have complete information, we will correspond with the new institution to process your transfer. At that point, you will need to be in contact with the new institution to receive your new DS-2019.
PLEASE NOTE: Your current, UIC academic department must be aware of, and approve of, your transfer to the new institution, therefore, your department head is required to sign the J-1 Transfer Out Form.

 

Transfer within UIC


Complete a J-1 Transfer Out Form.  Both your prospective and current academic departments must sign and provide information for this form.
Once we have complete information, we can update your DS-2019 and SEVIS record, if necessary. We will contact your new academic department when we have approved the transfer.  At that time, you will be able to begin your research activities at the new department.
