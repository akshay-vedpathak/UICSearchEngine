University Ambassadors
University Ambassadors are student leaders who exemplify UIC. Greeting, helping direct, and/or simply mingling, the University Ambassadors serve campus as representatives at high-profile university events. These students gain valuable leadership and specialized life skills through various professional development and hands on opportunities. University Ambassadors are a great link between the university, guests and the greater community. Serving as a University Ambassador is considered one of the highest honors while being a student at UIC.
