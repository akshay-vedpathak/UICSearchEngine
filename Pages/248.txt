In Chemistry, either the sequence CHEM 112, CHEM 114, or the sequence CHEM 116, CHEM 118 may be chosen. The choices are in the list below. Additionally, students must take a total of at least 12 credit hours, including that sequence, in the science area. Additional courses may be other courses on this list, courses that have any of these courses as prerequisites, or other sciences and quantitative social sciences courses from a list maintained by the Computer Science Department. Also, students preparing for the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination, which leads to becoming a Licensed Professional Engineer, are advised to take the Physics sequence of PHYS 141 and PHYS 142.Free ElectivesStudents preparing for the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination, which leads to becoming a Licensed Professional Engineer, are advised to use these hours to take CME 201 – Statics and one course from the following: CME 203 – Strength of Materials, CME 260 – Properties of Materials, and ME 211 – Fluid Mechanics I.Typical Schedule for the Computer Science Major, Software Engineering ConcentrationFIRST YEAR Fall semester – 14 hrsMath 180–Calculus I (5) CS 101–Introduction to Computing (3) Engl 160–English Composition I (3) Humanities/social sciences/art elective (3) Engr 100–Orientation (1 hrs, 0 credits) Spring semester – 15 hrsMath 181–Calculus II (5) Lab Science Sequence I (4) Engl 161–English Composition II (3) CS 102–Introduction to Programming (3)SECOND YEAR Fall semester – 16 hrsMath 210–Calculus III (3) Lab Science Sequence II (4) CS 201–Discrete Math/Data Structures I (4) Humanities/social science/art electives (3) Free elective (2)Spring semester – 17 hrs  CS 266–Computer Architecture I (4) CS 202–Discrete Math/Data Structures II (3) IE 342–Probability and Statistics (3) Science elective (4) Humanities/social science/art elective (3) THIRD YEAR Fall semester – 17 hrsCS 366–Computer Architecture II (4) CS 340–Software Design (4) Required mathematics course (3) IE 201–Engineering Economy (3) Humanities/social science/art elective (3) Spring semester – 16 hrsCS 301–Languages and Automata (3) Free elective (3) CS 385–Operating Systems Concepts (4) Required mathematics course (3) Humanities/social science/art elective (3) FOURTH YEAR Fall semester – 17 hrsCS 335–Computer Ethics (2) CS 401–Computer Algorithms (3) CS 440–Software Engineering I (3) Technical elective (3 hrs) Humanities/social sciences/art electives (6) Spring semester – 16 hrsCS 442–Software Engineering II (3) Technical electives (6) Humanities/social sciences/art electives (6) CS 376–Practicum in Oral Presentations (1)Connect With Us            312-413-0024Quick LinksInternal Links Make a Gift  |  © Copyright 2016.
