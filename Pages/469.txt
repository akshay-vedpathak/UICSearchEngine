It is primarily dedicated to the study of aerospace and propulsion engineering.  The club was formed in 2011 because the University of Illinois at Chicago does not currently have an aerospace engineering major for undergraduate students. We design and build remote controlled aircraft’s, high powered rockets, and quad-copters.The student chapter of the Audio Engineering Society at UIC provides opportunities for students to meet and talk with other members of the audio industry and learn directly from recognized experts in the audio field. Members are in contact with the most up-to-date products in the market and have access to the latest developments by researchers, and participate in meetings, workshops and discussion forums.The Engineering Design Team was created by a group of engineering students whose interests were grounded in technology and robotics. The club is designed to give students a chance to use their engineering knowledge to design and build robots in order to achieve a set of goals while competing against other teams. Members can expect to become part of an active and capable team that holds a strong passion for what they do. The experience and knowledge that they gain will nurture their passion to excel as UIC students and help them develop professional engineering attitudes.Engineering World Health inspires and mobilizes the engineering community to improve the quality of health care in vulnerable communities of the developing world. We achieve our mission through innovation and effective alliances with great partners. The UIC chapter provides detailed the projects, progress, and outreach programs. EWB’s objective is to design and implement new projects in developing countries concerning energy generation, safe water, public health, long-distance communications and sustainable agriculture. The student chapter of EWB at University of Illinois at Chicago aims to bring together students, local engineers, and communities in the less developed countries on collaborative projects.International Honor Society for Electrical and Computer Engineers. The society offers membership based on academic excellence, but also strives to assist the members to become better professionals and citizens. It encourages members to be a constructive force by helping fellow members and non-members alike to improve the standards of the profession, the courses of instruction, and the institutions generally where its chapters are established.The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is the world’s largest professional association dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. IEEE and its members inspire a global community through IEEE’s highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards and professional and educational activities. The IEEE UIC Chapter strives to promote the engineering process of creating, developing, integrating, sharing and applying knowledge about electro and information technologies as well as sciences to benefit our local community.Our Club is an opportunity for engaging with colleagues in a context of curiosity, uncertainty, and depth. Come explore interesting and unpredictable topics that stretch your horizons! It is a place for anyone in the UIC community to explore ideas and research that interests them. Journal Club effectively invites our community to say, “This is what I am reading, this is what I am interested in, and/or this is what I am thinking.”NSBE’s mission is to increase the number of culturally Black engineers, who excel academically, succeed professionally, and positively impact the community. In collaboration with the Minority Engineering Recruitment and Retention Program, NSBE motivates its members to join the Supplemental Instruction Program, or SI. SI is a tutoring program for students by students who have passed the class with a B or higher. Company representatives come specifically for NSBE. Outside of general body meetings, information sessions with companies like Google, IBM, ITW, GE, Navistar, and Baxter Healthcare give NSBE members an advantage in resume building, career preparation, and internship opportunities.The UIC Student Chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) strives to promote a learning environment for all members by bettering technical, design, and practical skills within the society and into the professional world. The students design, manufacture, test, and race a mini Baja vehicle and a formula race car for rigorous collegiate competitions.SHPE’s mission is to changes lives by empowering the Hispanic community to realize its fullest potential and to impact the world through STEM awareness, access, support and development. Its vision is a world where Hispanics are highly valued and influential as the leading innovators, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.SWE is a support group for all engineering students at UIC! They coordinate events throughout the academic year that range from attending conferences to conducting outreach events for elementary school students. SWE focuses on academic and professional development so students feel prepared for graduate school and/or the workforce. They strive to provide members with many different resources including scholarships and the opportunity to attend national and regional conferences. At the conferences, students can network with other future engineers and attend career fairs, which is a great way to find internships and full-time employment. UIC and the College of Engineering offer numerous student activities to complement your learning experience. Please visit the College of Engineering’s Student Activities page for more exciting opportunities.Connect With Us        312.996.6465 Quick LinksInternal LinksMake a Gift  |  © Copyright 2016.
