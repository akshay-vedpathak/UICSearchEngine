Learning Space Design Standards 
 
Office of Campus Learning Environments
The Office of Campus Learning Environments (OCLE) creates and renovates learning spaces to enable active learning and enhance student success.  The goal of each learning space project is to foster student engagement and thereby improve student learning outcomes.  Projects are both research-driven and customer-focused to support the University’s strategic priorities.
RECENT PROJECTS
Thomas Beckham Hall Classrooms



TBH 78-seat classroom

TBH Oases
The scope of the Thomas Beckham Hall project was to convert approximately 17,000 GSF of retail space on South Campus to general use classrooms in support of UIC’s growing student enrollment. The build-out created five 32-seat and two 78-seat classrooms for a total of 316 seats, Oases (informal learning) spaces with approximately 80 seats, a C-Stop with help desk, printing and recharging capabilities and offices for UIC Global/Shorelight Education staff.
