Graduate Studies











The graduate program provides students with opportunities to engage in a wide range of research based on shared knowledge and principles of engineering including mathematics, statistics, mechanics, chemistry, the physical sciences, and the properties of materials. Acquiring knowledge across several fields helps students formulate solutions to new and complex problems in the context of current social and economic considerations.
