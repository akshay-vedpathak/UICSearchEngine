We hope that these pages will provide a starting point to the information about the department, faculty, staff and students. We welcome prospective students, friends and colleagues to browse through the information that is provided here and to contact or visit us for more information.The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers Bachelor of Science, Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy Degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering.We are a Department of about 30 faculty, over 450 undergraduate and over 200 graduate students. The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department is very new, having been created in July of 2001 from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department.The origins of this department has its roots in the Department of Information Engineering which existed at the start of the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1965 and eventually evolved into the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department in 1982.The current Departmental structure is more focused, and provides an opportunity for the development of research and teaching programs in the areas of Electrical and Computer Engineering. We offer a strong and diverse program with nearly 30 experienced faculty members. Our broad and multidisciplinary thrusts have proved to be a significant growth opportunity in terms of research and funding success in all our major thrust areas and concentrations. Our successes in research funding, publications and recognitions of our faculty are listed in the following pages and under News Archive.We are proud that half of our faculty are Fellows of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and many are also Fellows of other peer societies. We are also particularly pleased to note that a number of our faculty members have received the prestigious CAREER awards from the National Science Foundation. The different research areas of our faculty are outlined in the following pages as are the research centers that exist in the department.Thank you for visiting the UIC ECE website. We hope you will find it interesting and informative. Please contact us if you have questions or comments.Sincerely,ECE Professor and Department HeadWhat is ECE?Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) is a broad discipline that encompasses a wide range of activities and is at the forefront of modern technology. Electrical and Computer Engineers model, design, fabricate, characterize and analyze devices and systems that can sense information or perform complex computational, communication, control as well as electrical power generation and distribution. A primary goal involves the use ofelectricity and electromagnetism for the generation, transmission, processing, storage, conversion, and control of information and energy. In a parallel theme, the fundamentals of circuits, systems, and algorithms associated with the design of programmable systems are used for computing, communications, control, or signal processing.Previous innovations in electrical and computer engineering have had a dramatic impact on the way in which we work and live: the transistor, integrated circuits, computers, radio and television, satellite transmission systems, lasers, fiber optic and wireless transmission systems, robotics and medical electronics. A major challenge for the future is the need for increasingly faster and more sophisticated methods of handling information at lower powers and reduced costs for the advanced communications and information-handling systems of the future. Today, the quest for increased speed and decreased energy consumption are driving electrical and computer engineering to novel materials and devices that have nanoscale features, and, systems and networks made with them; accordingly, electrical and computer engineering deals with key elements of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Thus electrical and computer engineers are at cutting-edge of the human interface of the technological “magic” that we see in so many areas of human endeavor.OTHER IMPORTANT LINKSConnect With Us        312.996.6465 Quick LinksInternal LinksMake a Gift  |  © Copyright 2016.
