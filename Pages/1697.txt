Arriving in the United States from Iran in 2010 as a twenty-three year old, Behzad Aghababazadeh (MS ’13) knew he’d left his safety net behind and would face challenges unlike those at home. But Behzad felt compelled to jump at the chance to stretch himself.Along with nearly fifty other Iranian students, he arrived in the Midwest through a joint program between University of Tehran and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. “It was the first U.S. program authorized after the Iranian revolution,” he explained. “The opportunity—coming from a developing country to a developed country—helped open my eyes to the best practices in the engineering field.”As a boy, Behzad was interested in electrical engineering—partly because he was drawn to computer hardware. “I had…

Bioengineering seniors Nancy Rios, Juan Rodriguez, Catherine Santis, and Melissa Wardlow were featured on the Spanish-language Univision news discussing the mouth guard and oral airway device they designed with classmate Johnny Villaseñor. The device, aimed at preventing complications that arise during intubation before surgery, won them a gold medal in their category at EXPO, the college’s senior design exhibition. The team was advised by volunteer Trevor Wesolowski, a senior design engineer at Design Integrity.

When Hamilton Elementary School 4th and 5th grade decided to have their first paper airplane contest, they reached out to MIE—to see if any engineers could help their students craft the best paper airplanes. Three MIE students and members of the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics club, Kyriakos Anastasopoulos, Collin Brady and Oliver Sanchez, rose to the occasion, heading to Hamilton Elementary on April 22, 2014 to guide Hamilton's students in their preparations."They [the students] were so excited to learn about how you may use engineering in your careers, and are hooked on making different planes with the suggestions you gave to them," said Kerrie Rovito, 4th-8th Grade Science Teacher at Hamilton.Along with helping the Hamilton Elementary students design…

Ninety-one freshman engineering students interned at private companies or UIC laboratories through the College’s Guaranteed Paid Internship Program launched in academic year 2013-2014. Here's what some of them have to say about how the experience jump-started their careers. Mohammed Hoda Electrical & Computer Engineering Internship: Exelon Corporation“The idea of working on big projects and seeing them implemented in front of your eyes has always been intriguing to me. Even the work that I did as an intern had an impact on the cybersecurity database used by the company. I learned a lot on the job, and I’m confident that this first work experience will help me advance in my career.”Raine Fisher Chemical Engineering Internship: Baxter International Inc.“I spent the summer writing protocols for…
