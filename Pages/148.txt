ABET ACCREDITATION
The College of Engineering was one of the original Colleges when University of Illinois at Chicago was founded in 1965 (originally named University of Illinois at Chicago Circle – renamed in 1982 after a merger with the University of Illinois at the Medical Center). In 1973, a number of the College’s programs received their first accreditation from the Engineers Council for Professional Development (now ABET).
