2018 SFAS Calendar


Students are responsible for reviewing the financial aid calendar and deadlines. Due to federal, state and institutional regulations, if the required paperwork is not submitted by the posted deadlines, students will be ineligible to receive assistance and responsible for any outstanding bill for that term.
