A word of advice: If finances are a concern, we recommend   that you do not rush into signing a housing contract (lease) until you   are aware of all your housing options. Calculate carefully what you can   realistically afford before making your decision.  Be aware that   heating costs may not be included in your rent and may be a separate   expense. Due to the climate in Chicago, this can be expensive.
