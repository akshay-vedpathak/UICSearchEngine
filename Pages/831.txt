Frequently Asked Questions





The Weekend MBA program and the Accelerated MBA start in the fall semester only. Students in the flexible program can start in the summer, fall or spring.
 



Online courses are often very different than traditional on-campus courses in terms of how the material is presented, the nature of the interaction among class members and the overall learning experience. However, the course load is at the same level as the face-to-face version; the only amount of time saved is your commute time to and from campus. Our online courses use the Blackboard software.
 



We strongly recommend at least two years of work experience before applying to our MBA program. Our students have an average of five years of work experience before beginning the UIC Liautaud MBA program. Those without this experience should consider the Accelerated MBA program.
 



Joint degree applicants are required to apply separately to both programs, making sure to follow the application procedures/requirements for each program. We strongly encourage applicants to apply to one program at a time. We recommend applicants apply to their second program upon gaining admission and enrolling in their first program. 
When applying to the second degree program, applicants are also required to submit the Change of Graduate Program form, with Section I completed.
We recommend that joint degree applicants work closely with academic advisors in both programs to insure proper sequencing of coursework and to assist in transferring application documents to the second application to avoid double submission of application documents. 
 



An undergraduate degree in business administration is not required. In fact, our Accelerated MBA program is designed specifically for those with an undergraduate background in a non-business field.  Approximately 50 percent of our student body does not have an undergraduate business background. We do recommend that students have had a class in statistics. If they have not, they can take one during their first semester.
 



You may be admitted to the Liautaud MBA program on a non-degree basis only in the following two cases:
1. If you have already completed an MBA or other approved management degree from an AACSB accredited institution and wish to pursue further course work, you may enroll in Liautaud MBA classes on a space-available basis as long as you maintain good academic standing. The application for admission and proof of MBA degree (a photocopy of your transcript or diploma showing completed MBA degree) must be submitted by the application deadline for the desired term of study.
2. If you are currently enrolled in an MBA program at another AACSB institution and wish to take courses that will be accepted by your university as transfer courses. You may enroll in Liautaud MBA courses to the extent approved by your MBA program, and by the Liautaud MBA Program. The Liautaud MBA application for admission, application fee, proof of baccalaureate degree, and letter from the director of your MBA program indicating that you are in good academic standing and list the courses approved to be transferred must be submitted by the application deadline for the desired term of study. You may also be asked by the admissions committee to provide additional information regarding your academic credentials.
