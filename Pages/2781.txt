Mind body services



The Mind/Body services at the Counseling Center are focused on fostering emotional, mental, and physical well-being. These programs strive to take the whole person into account by offering services that promote students’ overall health, resilience, and quality of life. These programs teach skills that can be applied across many different areas of your life, including academics, and promote optimal functioning, performance and success. You can register for some of these services online; others require a referral from your intake counselor.
