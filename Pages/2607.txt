Graduate College Bylaws

 








The UIC Graduate College is organized and administered according to its Bylaws . This governing document outlines the membership, purpose and goals of the UIC Graduate College with specific prescriptions for how these shall be carried forth. 
The original Graduate College Bylaws were approved by the Faculty Senate.  Amendments are first approved by the Graduate College Executive Committee, and then by vote at the Annual Meeting of the Graduate Faculty.
