Catalyst
Catalyst is a one-day intensive leadership retreat that allows students to engage in meaningful dialogue about leadership, change, and possibility. Facilitated by the nationally-recognized LeaderShape organization, Catalyst offers the chance to meet other UIC students interested in leadership, discover values, and get started on making a difference. By encouraging both collaborative work and individual reflection, Catalyst helps participants understand themselves and the steps to turn goals into actions.
