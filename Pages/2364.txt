Dependents
F-2s
The spouse and any unmarried minor children (under age 21) of the F-1  student are eligible to enter the United States in F-2 dependent  status. F-2 status can not be granted to parents or other relatives.  Each dependent must be in possession of his or her own SEVIS I-20 in  order to apply for an F-2 visa and enter the U.S. in F-2 status.
Entering the U.S. in F-2 Status : F-2 dependent may  enter at the      same time as the F-1 student, or may join the  previously admitted F-1 at a      later time. Each dependent must  present his      or her own SEVIS I-20, F-2 visa (except for Canadian  citizens) and a      passport (not to expire within six months) at the  port of entry.
Employment: F-2 dependents may not accept employment in the U.S.
Study: Full-time study is not      permitted for the  F-2 spouse. Avocational or recreational study is      permitted. (e.g.  English language courses, music/pottery classes). If the F-2 spouse  wishes to      study full-time he or she must first qualify for  admission to a college or      university. Then he or she would need to  request to change his or her      status to that of F-1. F-2 children  may only engage in      full-time study at the Kindergarten through 12th  grade level. F-2 children      who wish to study full-time beyond high  school must apply for a change of      status to F-1.
Extension of  F-2 Status: F-2 dependents are covered by the extension of stay granted to the F-1 visa holder.
U.S. Social Security Number: F-2 dependents may not  apply for an U.S. Social Security Number.
J-2s
The spouse and any unmarried minor children (under age 21) of the J-1  student are eligible to enter the U.S. in J-2 dependent status. J-2  status can not be granted to parents or other relatives. Each dependent  must be in possession of his or her own SEVIS DS-2019 in order to apply  for an J-2 visa and enter the U.S. in J-2 status.
Entering the U.S. in J-2 Status : J-2 dependent may  enter at the      same time as the J-1 student, or may join the  previously admitted J-1 at a      later time. Each dependent must  present his      or her own SEVIS DS-2019, J-2 visa (except for Canadian  citizens) and a      passport (not to expire within six months) at the  port of entry.
 
Employment: J-2 dependents are permitted to apply  for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from the U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services.  In order to be work-eligible in the U.S.,  employment may not begin until the EAD card has been received and the  dates on the card are valid.  Please visit the  section of our website for more information about how to apply.
Study: J-2 dependents are eligible for  degree-seeking study in the U.S. as long as the primary J-1 visa holder  is maintaining his/her status. J-2s will not be eligible for on-campus employment unless they possess an EAD card.
Extension of J-2 status: J-2 dependents are covered by the extension of stay granted to the J-1 visa holder.
 
U.S. Social Security Number: J-2 dependents may apply for an U.S. Social Security Number only with a valid EAD Card, DS-2019, and passport.
