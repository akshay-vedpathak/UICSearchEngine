          How do I update my UIC email forwarding?        




Tags: , , , Service: , , Your UIC email address is in the form netid@uic.edu, where 'netid' is your UIC NetID. This is an email forwarding address, not an actual email account. In order to be used, netid@uic.edu must forward to an actual email account, which for most people will be a UIC email account managed by ACCC.
For students, faculty, and staff, your netid@uic.edu email must route to a UIC email account. The only exceptions to this policy apply to the following special cases:
Individuals whose primary affiliation is with another University of Illinois campus may forward to an email address in one of the following domains: uic.edu, uis.edu, illinois.edu and uillinois.edu.
Persons who receive a UIC NetID in relation to a role outside of being a UIC student or employee may have the option to forward to a non-University account.
You may log in with your UIC NetID & password to view or . The options you see after logging in will be based on the policies for your role as described above, and may include:
Select from your existing ACCC email accounts;
Create a new account (if applicable);
Enter the email address of another email account that you own (within allowed domains).
Faculty and staff who do not already have a UIC Exchange Online account will be presented with the option to create one. Students who do not already have a UIC Gmail (GoogleApps) account will be presented with this option instead.
