Work Authorization


Work only in the authorized place of
    employment and for the period approved in your TN invitation letter and
    I-94. If your job ends sooner than the invitation letter end date, your
    status ends on the same day. See Grace Periods below.
Have the department notify OIS if significant
    change in duties, responsibilities, salary or work site is expected during
    your authorized employment. An amended petition may be necessary.
Do not accept additional employment or work at
    an additional location without consulting with OIS in advance. 
You can have more than one TN sponsor,
    but this requires either a separate I-129 filing to USCIS or a reentry
    with new employer sponsor letters shown to U.S. Customs and Border
    Protection (CBP).  

 

Immigration Documents


Maintain a valid passport at all times, valid
    for at least six months into the future.
Retain copies of all immigration documents
    including: current and expired passports, Forms I-797, I-94, etc.
The I-797 approval notice is your property (if applicable); there is a fee to request a duplicate I-797 approval, if lost.

I-94: Always review and save your new I-94
    after reentry at: www.cbp.gov/I94.  

Form I-94 must indicate "Admitted as:
        TN" and “Admitted until date” that matches your invitation letter or
        I-797 approval. 
Note: Individuals from Mexico entering the U.S. in TN status are
        often entered for only 1 year. 
Incorrect end date: If your I-94 indicates any
        other expiration date, contact OIS.  Passport expiry within six
        months is a common reason for a shortened I-94. If this occurs, consult
        with OIS. 


 

Renewals and Validity Period


Your department will need to initiate the TN
    extension process 2-4 months prior to your TN expiry date. Keep in mind that TN
    status can be extended indefinitely in three year increments.

 

Intent


TN status is a non-immigrant status,
    which means your intent to remain in the United States is temporary. If your department
    is interested in sponsoring you for permanent residency, contact OIS to discuss
    possible options. You may also consult our “Use of
    Attorneys Policy” and “UIC
    Sponsorship of Permanent Immigrant Visas” information.


 

TDs


TD dependents are not eligible to work, or volunteer
    to work. They may attend school. Consult OIS if you have questions.

 

Address Changes


Report any change in residential address,
    within 10 days of moving, to USCIS (Form
    AR-11), to OIS by email ois@uic.edu, and via
    UIC’s My
    Profile page.

 

Taxes


Individuals in TN status are required to file
    both state and federal taxes.

 

Travel and Visa Process


Canadian Citizens: 

No visa
        stamp is required for entry to the U.S.
Present the
        following at the port of entry: TN invitation letter completed by the
        department and approved by OIS, valid Canadian passport, TN application
        fee, evidence of degree showing that you qualify for the position,
        evidence that your stay is temporary in nature, original I-797 approval notice, if applicable.


Mexican Citizens: 

Visa stamp required – review required
        consulate-specific documents.
Schedule an appointment with the U.S.
        Consulate/Embassy and complete Form DS-160 with
        fee.  
Review consulate/embassy website for
        guidance about required documents. We suggest bringing:

Passport
            (valid for six months beyond reentry date)
TN
            invitation letter completed by the department and approved by OIS
Evidence
            of degree showing you qualify for the position
Evidence
            that your stay in the U.S. remains temporary in nature
Original I-797 approval notice, if applicable



TD dependents: 

In addition to the above, they should bring
        proof of their dependent status (marriage or birth certificate) as well as
        evidence that their stay remains temporary.


 

Grace Periods


You have a 10-day grace period after the end
    date of your stay in TN status. You may not work during this period; it is
    time to prepare to leave the U.S., change status, etc.
If your department ends your employment before
    end date of the TN invitation you may remain in the U.S. for 60 days, or
    until your petition end date (whichever is sooner) and have a new sponsor
    file a petition for you. See “portability” below.

 

Portability


It is possible to “port”/“transfer” your TN
    status to another employer; the new employer will file a Form I-129 on your
    behalf. Employment should be continuous from UIC to the next employer. If your
    department ends your employment early, you may have up to 60 days to remain in
    the country and seek other employment. You may not work or volunteer during the
    transitional time. Your future TN sponsor will advise you on this process and
    notify you when you may begin your new employment. Alternatively, you could
    travel to change employers.

 

Departure


You must submit a Departure
    Verification Form upon completion of employment. This form is
    required regardless of your departure reason: leaving the U.S.,
    changing employers, or changing immigration status.

 

Unlawful Presence


This occurs when you stay beyond the ending
    date of your I-94 or upon determination by Department of Homeland Security. Consequences
    include a 3-year bar from reentering the U.S. if you have stayed unlawfully in
    the U.S. for 180 days or more, and a 10-year bar if you remain unlawfully in
    the U.S. for 360 days or more. Violation of your TN status makes you ineligible
    for any immigration benefits. This does not apply if a timely, non-frivolous
    petition to extend your stay has been received by the USCIS prior to the end
    date of your I-94.
