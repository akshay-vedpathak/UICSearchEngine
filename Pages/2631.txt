There has never been a more exciting time to pursue advanced study. New fields of scholarship and new approaches in traditional fields are providing today’s graduate students with the ideas, skills, and disciplines to shape the world around them.
Over 8,100 graduate students at UIC are enrolled in 67 doctoral and 93 master’s programs. We offer nationally ranked programs, award-winning faculty, and one of the most diverse graduate student bodies in the nation, all within the heart of metropolitan Chicago. This year, UIC is ranked 19th in the world in the Times Higher Education’s Top 100 Universities under the age of 50.
