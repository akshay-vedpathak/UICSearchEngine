InsuranceEXCHANGE VISITOR INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
The U.S. Department of State requires medical insurance for all J-1  Exchange Visitors and their dependents.  To maintain lawful status, J-1  visitors and their J-2 dependents must have health insurance that meets  the minimum requirements as ,  at all times during the J program.  J-1 Exchange Visitors sponsored by  UIC are responsible for verifying that their health insurance meets  these requirements.  J-1 Exchange Visitors must bring proof of insurance  to the Office of International Services (OIS) upon arrival.  Failure to  provide proof of insurance may result in the loss of the J-1  immigration status and termination in the Exchange Visitor program.
Note for students and those scholars paid by UIC: If you are eligible, or become eligible, for UIC health insurance, please be aware that UIC insurance plans do not  include medical evacuation and repatriation for a foreign national  being flown from the United States to his/her country.  Therefore,  supplemental insurance, to include medical evacuation and repatriation  for the J-1 and his/her dependents, will need to be purchased in order  to maintain lawful status.
  
Please note: Detailed insurance information will be sent with exchange visitor welcome and admissions packets.
