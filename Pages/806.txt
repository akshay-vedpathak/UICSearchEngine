NEXTAn Educational Approach to Cavity Prevention






 

HEALTHY SMILES
An Educational Approach to Cavity Prevention
One of the best ways we’ve found to prevent cavities is by educating our patients to take control of their oral health. Sure, it takes a little longer, but it’s well worth it, and our patients appreciate the personalized approach.

Research Themes




 
Craniofacial Pathobiology
Working to improve treatment of oral cancer, caries, peridontal and other oral diseases. We are leading interdisciplinary investigations in the development and function of the craniofacial complex to better understand processes that occur within cells and tissues to maintain health and control growth and development.







 
Regenerative Science
Moving beyond tissue replacement, using materials to enable our bodies to regenerate damaged and failing tissues. Our researchers are leading investigations into how materials interact with living tissues, and the building of tissue replacements for the growth of cells/tissues to replace lost tissues. The  is a unique community of scientists and clinicians devoted to the study of injury, wound healing, and regeneration. The  is a NIH funded center studying the properties of the tooth in order to develop reparative/regenerative biomaterials to replace lost tooth structure.







 
Clinical, Translational & Community Research
Leading transformative studies to improve oral health outcomes both in the clinic and the community. We have several centers and investigators focused on the study of the incidence and prevalence of disease; measuring outcomes of interventions; and safety and efficacy of drugs, devices, and treatments in individuals. We are also investigating how and why efforts to promote oral health through intervention are accepted by communities. 










College Smiles












 







When it comes to fighting off cavities, we need all the help we can get, beyond the obvious healthy habits of regular brushing and flossing. Here are several more useful habits you can pick up to strengthen your daily routine for a healthy and beautiful smile.
