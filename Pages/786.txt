Student Employment
Meeting student employment needs











We are a centralized service that offers assistance to UIC students, departments and off-campus employers. Such employment not only provides students with a means of earning money, it also provides students an opportunity to develop new skills and positive work habits which will ensure professional success. Students are expected to consistently execute job responsibilities in a satisfactory manner. In addition, we sponsor various job fairs throughout the year and a series of career development workshops.
Mission
Our mission is to enhance student learning and meet departmental student employment needs by providing meaningful work experiences.
