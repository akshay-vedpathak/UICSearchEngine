          How do I import my other Google Calendar into GoogleApps@UIC?        




Tags: Service: If you already have a gmail.com Google account and want to have the calendar associated with that account included in your GoogleApps@UIC calendar, log in to your other Google account and  "share" your other Google calendar with your GoogleApps@UIC calendar.
Login to your other Google calendar.
Click on the down arrow to the right of the calendar's name in the list of your calendars under My Calendars on the left, and select Calendar settings from the menu that opens.
Click the Share this Calendar link.
Under Share with specific people, type your NetID@uic.edu in the Person box.
Click Add Person.
