Laurette Kirstein Scholarship
 
History
Professor Kirstein began her career with the University of Illinois in 1946 teaching English at Navy Pier. She went on to found the Office of International Services in 1961 and served as its director until her retirement in 1993. She was known for her tireless dedication to helping international students, faculty and staff with their transitions to both a new country and a new university. The Laurette Kirstein Foreign Student Fund, created through a generous gift from Professor Kirstein’s estate, continues her legacy by providing scholarship support for international students.
Eligibility
The Laurette Kirstein Scholarship recognizes students who display academic excellence and meet the following requirements:

An international student* currently enrolled full-time at UIC pursuing either an undergraduate or graduate degree
A minimum UIC cumulative GPA of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale
Must have completed at least one semester of coursework at UIC at the time of application

*The term "international student" encompasses any student enrolled at UIC who is neither a U.S. citizen nor a permanent resident, who holds a valid non-immigrant visa status, and is maintaining his/her status.  In addition to those individuals who entered the U.S. on student visas, this population includes students in dependent status who are eligible to enroll full-time in an academic program.
Application Process
The Office of International Services typically awards the scholarship once a year during the spring semester. Around February the OIS website is updated and an email is sent to the UIC international community announcing the availability of updated application details, including materials, process, and deadlines. Outside the application window, students may send questions about the scholarship to ois@uic.edu.
