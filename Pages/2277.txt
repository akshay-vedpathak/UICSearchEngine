General Travel Advice
Contact your airline prior to all travel, to inquire about transit  visas or any other requirements for travel both domestically and  internationally. A transit visa may be required, even for layovers in  countries other than your final destination. Please review  prior to travel.


Visa 
 
A visa is affixed in your passport by the U.S. Consulate or Embassy  abroad and allows you to travel to the U.S. It only needs to be valid  for your entry into the U.S., and does not have to remain valid  throughout your stay in the U.S., provided that you maintain your  immigration status. If you travel outside of the U.S. and need to  re-enter, you must have a valid/unexpired visa to return. There are  exceptions to this rule for travel to Canada, Mexico, and the adjacent  islands.*
*See “Automatic Visa Revalidation” below.

 Form I-94  
An I-94 is an arrival and departure record that you receive at  the Port of Entry (such as the airport) when entering the U.S. Individuals arriving to the U.S. after 04/26/2013 may . Prior to 04/26/2013 the I-94 was a paper form filled out at the Port of Entry or on the airplane. Your I-94 must remain valid at  all times. When departing the U.S., you will turn in your I-94 paper card (if applicable),  unless you are taking advantage of AVR.* If you forget to return your  I-94 when exiting the U.S. permanently, you should   to make an effort to send it back to Department of Homeland Security (DHS/immigration).  

 
 How Do I Obtain or Renew A Visa?

When applying for a new visa, please find out:
    

whether an appointment is required, and it may take to process your request.
what documents, forms, photos and fees are required
if they allow visa applications from third country nationals (“TCNs”)


Be prepared to show evidence of your financial resources.
Bring appropriate immigration documents: Form I-20, DS-2019, or I-797 (See “Quick Reference Table” below)
If an initial F-1 or J-1, pay the .
Schedule a flight that allows sufficient time for you to obtain a  visa.  Additional security checks are possible for certain individuals,  which may result in delays of 30+ business days.
Make sure your passport is valid for 6 months from date of visa application.
Check with local  for possible additional documentation needed.
If you need a new visa and you travel outside the U.S., be aware  that you are never guaranteed that a new visa will be issued, especially  if you apply at a U.S. embassy or consulate in a country other than  your home country.
If you travel to a country other than your home country, you may  need a visa to enter that country.  Check that country’s immigration  website for more information.
You may need a transit visa if arriving in a third country en route to another country.
If you have changed status within the U.S. and now want to travel  outside of the U.S., you will need to obtain a new entry visa to match  your current status to return to the U.S.
