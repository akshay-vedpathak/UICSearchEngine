Welcome Service Project




Welcome Service Project
The Welcome Service Project is an annual event for incoming first year and transfer students. Occurring the week or weekend before the start of the fall semester, the project gives students an opportunity to provide service as a class, build a UIC community, and kick off their journey to becoming an active citizen.
This year's Welcome Service Project will take place on August 24, 2018.
