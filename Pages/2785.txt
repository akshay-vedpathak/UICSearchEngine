I want to commit suicide, I have a plan and I don’t think I can stop myself.

Call UIC Campus Police at 312-355-5555. Don’t worry, you won’t be arrested. The operator will get you the help you need. Typically, someone with training in suicide prevention will come to your location, talk to you, and help you with a plan that will keep you alive.
If you are on campus, go to the UIC Hospital Emergency Room (1740 W Taylor St Chicago, IL 60686; (312) 996-7298). One or more medical professionals will ask you several questions, and you may be admitted to stay in the hospital and receive treatment until you are feeling better. Many insurance policies will cover necessary emergency services obtained in most hospital emergency rooms, and UIC Hospital Inpatient Psychiatry is part of the Campus Care network of approved treatment facilities. Going to the ER can be scary, but try your best to let the doctors and nurses take care of you. No one will know about your hospitalization unless you give permission or have designated a Mental Health Emergency Contact.
