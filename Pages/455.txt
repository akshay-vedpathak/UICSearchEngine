Certificate Programs List
The University of Illinois at Chicago broadly classifies certificates as either IBHE (Illinois Board of Higher Education) certificates or UIC Campus certificates.
IBHE certificates require the completion of more semester hours than Campus certificates.  Also, students admitted to IBHE certificates are classified as degree-seeking.  Students admitted to UIC Campus certificates are classified as nondegree.
