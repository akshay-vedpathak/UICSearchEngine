The two-day event kicked off on Friday evening as participants heard from both industry professionals and fellow hackers who described potential problems teams could tackle throughout the weekend. The UIC team, who went by the name “PoliThinkers,” was made up of ECE students Michele Calvi and Andrea Ciccardi; CS students Giovanni Agugini Bassi, Iacopo Olivo, Francesco Pinci, and BioEngineering alumna Chiara Gatti. The team are all part of UIC’s master’s degree contract programs between the College of Engineering and Politecnico di Torino and Politecnico…    October 31, 2018Professor Seferoglu Awarded Five Grants Totaling More Than $1.3M ECE Professor Hulya Seferoglu is on a roll! The prolific researcher was awarded five grants in the recent months for a total of more than $1.3 million in research funding. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) professor has received awards from the National Science Foundation, Army Research Lab, Army Research Office, National Institute of Standards and Technology and an industry grant. She is UIC’s principal investigator (PI) for four of these five awards. Each grant is for a different research project, but they all have a common thread – Edge computing. Edge computing is about extending the frontier of computing applications, data, and services away from centralized nodes to the logical…    September 25, 2018Tesla has the Model S, Nissan offers the Leaf, and Chevy makes the Bolt. Soon, UIC will have an electric car, too. A new student organization in the College of Engineering called Vehicle Electronics and System Engineering (VESE) is engineering’s newest organization offering students an opportunity to be pioneers as they start designing and building a formula one electric race car to compete in an SAE sanctioned competition next semester in Lincoln, Nebraska, in May. “The beauty of our car is that it is based on electrical systems, but there are mechanical components that have to be built like any other race car,” said Amru Qutub, a student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and the president…    September 6, 2018This week, The New York Times referenced ECE Professor James C. Lin's research in its story about how U.S. Embassy workers in Cuba may have been affected by microwave weapons. "But in a scientific paper that same month, James C. Lin of the University of Illinois, a leading investigator of the Frey effect, described the diplomatic ills as plausibly arising from microwave beams. Dr. Lin is the editor-in-chief of Bio Electro Magnetics, a peer-reviewed journal that explores the effects of radio waves and electromagnetic fields on living things." "In his paper, he said high-intensity beams of microwaves could have caused the diplomats to experience not just loud noises but nausea, headaches and vertigo, as well as possible brain-tissue injury. The…    August 1, 2018The longevity of electronic devices is tested in many ways as they endure the rigors of daily usage. Even when they are treated with the utmost care, they still have a major challenge to overcome – the removal of heat. To alleviate this problem, ECE Assistant Professor Junxia “Lucy” Shi and her team of researchers in the Advanced Semiconductor Materials and Devices Laboratory at UIC are focusing on using a novel method for cooling hotspots in electronics and capturing the wasted heat to use to power the devices. The new technique additionally has the potential to expand the longevity of electronic components. The results of their research were recently published in the prestigious journals Scientific Reports and Physical Review Materials.…    July 17, 2018Located in the heart of Chicago, UIC offers students a unique educational experience and work opportunities in a world-class city. For Alex Iacobucci, UIC’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) set the stage for his professional career as an engineer and provides him with the opportunity to do some acting outside the office. Iacobucci, came to ECE through the UIC College of Engineering, which has a partnership with one of the top engineering schools in Italy – Polytechnic University of Turin – and provides the students with a dual master’s degree. At the completion of the program, students get a degree from the Italian university and UIC. They take one semester in Italy and one semester at UIC, where…    June 25, 2018In Memoriam: Professor Emeritus Wolfgang-Martin Boerner July 26, 1937- May 25, 2018It is with the greatest sadness and regret that we announce that our dear friend and highly admired colleague Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Professor Emeritus Wolfgang-Martin Boerner passed away on May 25, 2018 at the age of 80.He had an illustrious career and was undoubtedly a most eminent researcher and giant in the general area of electromagnetics and especially in remote sensing and polarimetric imaging radar. Boerner had a distinguished record of accomplishments and recognition, and was a Life Fellow of IEEE, Optical Society of America, International Society for Optical and Photogrammetric Engineering, Society for Exploration Geophysics, SPIE, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Institute of…    June 1, 2018ECE students showed their talents and ingenuity during the 29th Annual UIC Engineering Senior Design Expo on Friday, April 27, at the UIC Forum. ECE students were among more than 528 seniors from the College of Engineering (COE) presenting within 27 project categories. Eleven ECE teams were named Best in Category – some teams tied for first - in the eight categories in which they participated. The Best in Category In the Electronics Engineering category, Paul Benjamin Johnson and Joshua H. Tang nabbed the top spot with their Velo Nexus.The project leverages the power of a smartphone to add additional sensors easily and on demand allow for variability for an individual user’s needs and wants related to a bicycle ride.  Controlling…    AFFILIATESConnect With Us        312.996.6465 Quick LinksInternal LinksMake a Gift  |  © Copyright 2016.
