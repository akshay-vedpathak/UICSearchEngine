Transportation 
Chicago is home to two :  The majority of International flights fly into O’Hare’s International Terminal.
There are several ways to reach our campus from either airport. You may opt to take a taxi, bus, or subway, .
From Chicago O’Hare Airport 
A taxi will cost about $40-$45 from  to downtown Chicago. Be sure the    is on during your ride and that you pay only the amount displayed on   the meter (a 15-20% tip is customary). Do not establish a set fee with   the taxi driver. Avoid the use of expensive “limousines”. Taxi   companies can pick you up at an established address. When using this   service, the cab “starts running” or begins to charge you once you get   in the cab. 
 
:
FlashCab:  773-561-1444
YellowCab:  773-907-0020
The    shuttle (lower level — O’Hare) costs approximately $30 one-way and $50   round-trip and takes you anywhere downtown. The Go Airport Express shuttle operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. You can make a reservation   for the shuttle online or call 1-773-247-1200. From downtown, a taxi can   take you to the UIC campus for about $15.
If you can carry your own luggage, you may want to take the subway,   also known as the “CTA Rapid Transit train” or “L”. You can board the L   directly from the lower level at O’Hare to either of the UIC campus   stops, “UIC/Halsted” or “Racine”. As of January 2018, the cost for a one-way pass departing from O'Hare is $5. The trip takes approximately 1 hour. A one-way pass departing from other locations is $2.50 and an additional $.25 for transfers.
The CTA Train Schedules can be found at 
From Midway Airport 
If you arrive at  southwest of the city, you may take a taxi directly to the campus, or   use The  shuttle to go to anywhere downtown. A  one-way trip from Midway Airport costs $30 and a round-trip is $50. The Go Airport Express shuttle operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. From downtown, you can  take  a cab to UIC for about $15.
You may also take the Orange line “L”/CTA from Midway Airport to the   “Clark/Lake” stop,  transfer to the Blue line and disembark at the   “UIC/Halsted” or “Racine” stops.
The University is not able to  provide   transportation from  the airports to the campus. Please keep  our telephone number    available in case of an emergency: 1(312)  996-3121. University offices  are   closed on Saturdays, Sundays and  holidays.
