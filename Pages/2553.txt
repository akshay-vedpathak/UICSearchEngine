Confidentiality of Records

 








As custodian of student records, the University assumes an implicit trust and, accordingly, uses extreme care and concern in recording and disseminating information about students. The University policy is in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
The Office of Admissions and Records issues transcripts of official records only at the written request of the student and payment of the transcript fee (see ). The same holds true for academic information needed for financial assistance or honors recognition. Class schedules are not released to unauthorized persons. UIC Student Records policy governs record keeping and release.
