          How do I create a calendar for a Google Group?        




Tags: , , Service: Google Groups cannot have calendars of their own, but you can create a subcalendar in your GoogleApps@UIC account for the group and share that with your group:
.
Then ; use the group's email address.
Then each member of the group will receive an email message telling them about the calendar; they can .
Please note that . You also don’t have to enter the email addresses of the members of the group individually, just adding the group's email address is enough.
You can enable alarms or notifications of the meeting in the shared calendar. This cannot be done for everyone the calendar is shared with, each person in the group has to do this.
Open Google Calendar.
Click Settings under My calendars on the left.
Click Notifications beside the calendar’s name.
Turn on the types of notifications that you would like to enable.
Click Save, then Back to calendar.
