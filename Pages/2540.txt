Graduate Pathways to Success

 








The Graduate College is expanding its current efforts to prepare and recruit more underrepresented minority college students to graduate study at UIC.  Specifically, we have developed the Graduate Pathways to Success Program to nurture UIC undergraduates with potential to enter graduate studies.  
The Graduate Pathways to Success Program strengthens and builds upon institutional relationships both internally and externally to also attract more underrepresented students to graduate study at UIC. Internally, the program will identify faculty advisors, within UIC, willing to nominate such students to facilitate recruitment and a more successful graduate school experience. Externally, the program will collaborate with other institutions to establish a mutually beneficial relationship to prepare, recruit and enroll talented students. We have good placement records with our Sumer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) and, previously, with our Ronald E. McNair Program. 
In 2009, the first group of 10 students began the Graduate Pathways to Success Program with a faculty member who supervised each student's research project. These students completed a series of introductory workshops on research-oriented and graduate-school oriented topics and worked on a research project of their choosing under the supervision of a UIC faculty member.
