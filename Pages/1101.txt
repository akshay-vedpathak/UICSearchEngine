Get Involved with Volunteer Experiences (GIVE)
Monthly GIVE events offer students the opportunity to come together and serve local communities on a regular basis. GIVE events include 10-30 students and usually last 2-4 hours. Past GIVE events have included activities like craft projects to support sexual assault awareness, family game nights with children experiencing homelessness, sorting donations for low-income families, and more!
