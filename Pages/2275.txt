F-1 Student EmploymentOn-Campus Employment:
F-1 students are automatically eligible to accept on-campus
employment at UIC as long as the student is here, and is registered for
classes(Note: off-campus employment is restricted, see below). UIC
employment cannot exceed 20 hours per week when school is in session; this amount includes all other authorized employment. International students may work more than 20 hours per week during official university breaks only (Winter Break, Summer).
On-campus employment does not need to be related to the student’s field of study.
Note: Graduate Assistantships correspond to a percentage of hours to be worked each week:

50% = 20 hours per week
33% = 14-15 hours per week
25% = 10 hours per week

Off-Campus Employment:
F-1 students are eligible for off-campus employment authorization in
the form of Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical
Training. Authorization can be given if the student has been maintaining
their status and if they meet other eligibility requirements (explained
below).
Curricular Practical Training (CPT):
CPT is off-campus training in the form of an internship, co-op, or
practicum that is an integral part of an established curriculum. CPT
must be either required or course credit must be given toward the
student’s degree program. CPT is an option for students who will
continue to work towards their degree. To apply for CPT, the completed 
must be submitted to an OIS advisor during open advising hours. The
student must have the approved CPT I-20 before they begin training.
Optional Practical Training (OPT):
F-1 students are eligible for up to twelve months of Optional
Practical Training (OPT) authorization for each level of study (example
BS, MS, PhD). The majority of students apply for OPT as they near the
end of their academic studies. Utilizing OPT after completion of studies
allows students the opportunity to use the skills they have learned at
UIC in a “real world” environment.
Pre-completion Optional Practical Training may be done during
specific times before the student graduates, or after they graduate. F-1
students are eligible for up to twelve months of OPT authorization for
each level of study (example BS, MS, PhD). Students must attend a
mandatory OIS OPT Workshop to obtain the application (see below) prior
to applying for OPT.
Mandatory Workshop for Those Applying for OPT:
The Office of International Services conducts mandatory workshops for
F-1 international students interested in applying for Optional
Practical Training (OPT) throughout the semester. Students applying for
OPT must first attend one of these workshops. There, students will learn
about the OPT application process, maintaining immigration status and
other important procedures. Dates and times for these workshops are
listed on the .
17-Month Extension of OPT (STEM):
F-1 students approved for standard post-completion OPT  based on a
bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a STEM (science, technology,
engineering, mathematics) field that appears on the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) STEM-Designated Degree Program List can apply to
USCIS for a one-time 17-month extension of post-completion OPT (for a
total eligibility of up to 29 months). To be eligible for the extension,
the student must have obtained their diploma from UIC, the student's
employer must be registered in E-Verify and must agree to report to OIS
when the student is terminated or leaves employment. The student must
apply for the STEM OPT extension before their standard period of
post-completion OPT expires.
Starting May 10, 2016, new rules
to strengthen and enhance the optional practical training (OPT) program
for F-1 international students in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) fields go into effect. Changes included in this final
rule will affect how students, employers, and UIC administrators
interact with the OPT STEM extension. Below is a list of the major
highlights included in the final rule. Additionally, the Student
Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) has prepared valuable resources to
assist with this transition, many of which are posted to the  website. 
Highlights of the major changes found in the 24-Month STEM OPT Extension Final Rule
The new rule:

Lengthens the STEM OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months
Strengthens the educational component of the STEM OPT extension
    by requiring students and employers to complete an individualized
    training plan
Increases the number of times a student can participate in the
    STEM OPT extension from one to two over the course of the academic
    career
Expands eligibility for the STEM OPT extension, under certain
    circumstances, to students who hold a prior STEM-qualifying degree 
Allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enforce the new rule through site visits to employers
Provides a  for students who submitted or will submit a STEM OPT extension application prior to May 10, 2016
The 2016 STEM OPT 24-month extension final rule is effective beginning May 10, 2016. Previously used 17-month STEM OPT regulations remain in effect through May 9, 2016. For the complete text of DHS’s final rule, please see the .
