Estimating EFC




Estimating EFC
The federal government expects students and families to contribute to the cost of college to the extent that they are able. After receiving a FAFSA the federal government determines a student’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC), which will be listed on the FAFSA completion page and the UIC award letter.
Important Note: The EFC is NOT the sum that a student/family will pay to the university. Exact costs for attending UIC are determined after a complete review of financial aid materials.
 to get an estimate of your EFC.
