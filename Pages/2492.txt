Message from the Dean

 









UIC ranks among the nation's top 54 universities in federal research funding and is Chicago's largest university with 27,000 students, 12,000 faculty and staff, 15 colleges and the state's major public medical center. UIC is one of 108 research universities with very high research activity (Carnegie Foundation).
The Graduate College at the University of Illinois at Chicago is dedicated to a simple idea: bringing together superb students with outstanding research faculty in a diverse and stimulating urban environment.
There has never been a more exciting time to pursue advanced study. New fields of learning and new approaches in traditional fields are providing today's graduate students with the ideas, skills, and disciplines to shape the world around them.
UIC's 7,000 graduate students are enrolled in nearly fifty PhD programs and over eighty masters programs, spanning the range of Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences and Engineering. Nationally ranked programs, award-winning faculty, and one of the most diverse graduate student bodies in the nation are among the advantages UIC has to offer, all within the heart of metropolitan Chicago. I invite you to make it your home.
