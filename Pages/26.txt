Among the most respected accreditation organizations in the U.S., ABET has provided leadership and quality assurance in higher education for over 75 years.PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVESThe Computer Science B.S. Program is designed to prepare graduates for productive and rewarding careers; it is expected that within a few years of receiving their degree, graduates will have attained the following:Depth: Through professional practice or advanced study in computer science, graduates will apply the foundational concepts of the discipline including design, implementation and analysis of computing systems.Breadth: Graduates will demonstrate an awareness of broad societal and ethical issues in computing as they engage in productive public or private sector careers or graduate study.Professionalism: As participants in complex modern work environment, graduates will demonstrate clear communication skills, engage in responsible teamwork practices, and exhibit ethical and professional attitudes.Learning: Graduates will pursue lifelong learning that builds on the foundational knowledge and skills of computer science acquired in their undergraduate program in pursuit of their goalsENROLLMENT AND GRADUATION TRENDSSTUDENT OUTCOMESThe program’s Student Outcomes prepare graduates to attain the program Educational Objectives. The Student Outcomes of the Computer Science B.S. Program as specified by ABET Accreditation Criteria of the Computer Science are as follows:An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the disciplineAn ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solutionAn ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goalAn understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilitiesAn ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiencesAn ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations and societyRecognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional developmentAn ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practiceAn ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the trade-offs involved in design choices.An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity.The Computer Science coursework maps to these student outcomes as indicated below.
