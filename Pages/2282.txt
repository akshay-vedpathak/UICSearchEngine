Extension
F-1 And J-1 Student Program Extension Procedures
A student is eligible for a program extension if it is established  that the    delay in completing the program requirements has been caused  by a compelling    academic reason (such as changes in major field of  study, research topic, or    unexpected research problems), or  documented medical reasons.
When is a program extension necessary?

For students in F-1 status: a program extension is  necessary      if you plan on studying past the date in item #5, of your  current Form I-20.      Please see the date contained in the blank,  “…complete studies      not later than .”
For students in J-1 status: a program extension is necessary      if you plan on studying past the program end date in item #3 of your Form      DS-2019.

The end date listed on either Form I-20 or DS-2019 is considered  the “expiration”    date of your immigration status. If you do not apply  for a program extension    and you remain in the US, you will be  considered to be in violation of your    immigration status.
How to apply
Submit the following documentation to OIS at least 30-60 days prior    to the expiration of your status:

Obtain a letter recommending a program extension from your Academic  Advisor,      Dean, Director of Graduate Studies, or Department Head  (see sample letter      below).
Gather financial documents to show that you can support yourself (and any      dependents) for the entire period of the extension. OIS requires original      copies of financial documents, which are not more than six (6) months      old. Financial documentation might include one or more of the following:
    
Bank statement
Bank letter
Proof of assistantship and/or tuition waiver


Complete the “".

Additional information

Extensions may only be requested for 1 year at a time.
New/extended end date: The new immigration document  will      show that your program has been extended to a date that was  based on the completion      date stated by your Academic Advisor, Dean,  Director of Graduate Studies or      Department Head. Keep in mind that  if you complete your program of studies      before  the new expiration date listed on your form,      then your grace  period (if eligible) will begin from your program completion      date, not the date listed on the extended I-20/DS-2019.      By the end date of your grace period you have the following options:
    
leave the country
apply for work authorization
transfer to a new academic program/institution
change immigration status
in some other way maintain your legal status in the U.S.


Grace periods: Immigration allows a grace period  for international      students who have maintained their status during  their program. This is considered      to be time for you to prepare for  your departure from the US. This grace period      begins the day you  complete your program of study. F-1s receive 60-days and      J-1s  receive 30-days.

 Notes to the Academic Advisor, Dean, Director or Department    Head:

It is essential that the completion date indicated in the recommendation      letter be as accurate as possible.
A student is eligible for a program extension if it is established  that      the delay in completing the program requirements has been  caused by a compelling      academic reason (such as changes in major  field of study, research topic,      or unexpected research problems),  or documented medical reasons. Please explain      in detail the reason  for the extension.
Delays in completing program requirements, which are caused by  academic      probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for  extension of a program      of study.
