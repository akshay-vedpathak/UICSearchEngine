In the following semester an advising hold can be placed preventing registration, hold removed only after meeting with the DGSWhat this means and how it will be implementedThe Department will do random checks on graduate student registrationGraduate students registered for over 3 graduate CS didactic classes (at anytime in the registration cycle) will be emailed with a warning that they are exceeding the limit and given ample time to correct their registration; or receive permission to stay in class by discussing this matter with the DGS or Santhi.  The deadline to correct registration will be significantly shorter as the semester begins.Once the deadline is passed, if a student has not corrected their registration or received permission to stay – a hold will be placed on their account which prevents further registration of any kind (both add / drop)The Department will then decide which classes to drop and send paperwork to Registration so that the Registration office can drop the class(es) from the student’s scheduleAny exemptions have to be cleared by the DGS or Santhi in the Student Affairs Office (905 SEO) We expect this policy to benefit all students of 400 and 500 level courses by helping us to plan better and provide course offerings and seats that better meet all student needs.Connect With Us            312-413-0024Quick LinksInternal Links Make a Gift  |  © Copyright 2016.
