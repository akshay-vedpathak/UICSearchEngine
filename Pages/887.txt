Research Highlights








The wonders of graphene are numerous — it can enable flexible electronic components, enhance solar cell capacity, filter the finest subatomic particles and revolutionize batteries. Now, the “supermaterial” may one day be used to test for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS — a progressive, neurodegenerative disease which is diagnosed mostly by ruling out other disorders, according to new research from the University of Illinois at Chicago published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.











A University of Illinois at Chicago assistant professor has received a $100,000 grant to continue her work challenging the “demonization, warehousing and social exclusion of people” in the criminal justice system.











University of Illinois at Chicago scholars Wonhwa Cho and John Nitiss have been named fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers.











While many cells in our bodies can accumulate oncogenic mutations, the majority of these events do not lead to tumor formation as these abnormal cells are eliminated by defense mechanisms. Instead, tumors arise when a mutation happens in a particular cell type that is uniquely sensitive to it. Identifying such cancer cells of origin is essential to properly target cancer.

Dear Research Community,
The Effort Reporting System (ERS) is now open and ready for AY18 certifications to be completed. Effort is the time spent on all university activities. The ERS is designed to document effort actually expended by individuals on each sponsored award during AY18 (8/16/17 – 8/15/18) and reconcile effort committed in award document(s).  This effort can be paid directly by the award and/or other funding sources (i.e. cost shared) to ensure effort commitments are met.

Featured Faculty









Sandeep Jain, Associate Professor 2017 Inventor of the Year 

 Sandeep Jain is amongst the few clinical scientists in the field who have taken their research discovery from laboratory to the clinic and converted them to new therapies.
His research and clinical practice have both focused on very severe cases of dry eye disease caused by autoimmune disorders, in particular by a condition known as ocular graft versus host disease, which is a serious complication that occurs in patients with blood cancers who have undergone stem cell or bone marrow transplants. 









Kimberly Lawless, Professor2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Social Sciences 

 Kimberly Lawless, associate dean for research in the College of Education, believes that science literacy is a tool, and like any tool, be it a hammer, screwdriver or wrench, you need to learn what it is, what it does and when to use it.
“If you go through the world thinking that you only have a hammer, the only thing you can do is hammer,” said Lawless, professor of educational psychology. “But if you go through life with a complement of tools and you are able to fluidly mix and match those tools to the job that’s in front of you, you’re going to better accomplish the job.” 









Dima Mazen Qato, Assistant Professor2017 Researcher of the Year, Rising Star - Social Sciences 

 For more than 10 years, Dima Qato worked as a retail pharmacist and witnessed countless examples of the vital role pharmacies play in the public health system, particularly when it comes to access to and safe use of medications.
However, while many like Qato consider pharmacies to be an essential part of our health care system, the independent and chain retailers are not regulated by or held accountable to any of the groups that provide checks and balances for other essential health services, like care in hospitals and clinics. 









Isabel Cruz, Professor2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Natural Sciences and Engineering 

 Isabel Cruz makes sense of complex data.
“One of the aspects I work on is heterogeneous data — for example, how to make sense of data that is collected with different spatial and temporal granularities,” said Cruz, professor of computer science.
The U.S. Census, for example, collects data every 10 years, but other population data within a city may be taken every month or year.
“So if you want to tell the story of what’s happening in a city, you cannot put apples and oranges together,” she said. 









Richard Novak, Professor2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Clinical Sciences 

 Richard Novak has been working to identify therapies and vaccines for HIV since the 1980s, when the infection first started making the news as it spread among the gay community.
Novak was a young assistant professor of infectious disease at UIC when he pushed for the hospital to open a dedicated HIV clinic because the general infectious disease department wasn’t able to handle the influx of HIV patients. That clinic opened in 1989, and just a few years later, Novak received funding to open UIC’s first dedicated HIV treatment and prevention clinics in the community in 1992. 









Maria Argos, Associate Professor2017 Researcher of the Year, Rising Star - Clinical Sciences 

 What are the health effects of arsenic from drinking water and other sources?
That’s a question that Maria Argos aims to answer in her research studies.
Argos examines the levels of arsenic in drinking water primarily in Bangladesh, and the associated health effects for people who live there. 









Parasani Subbaiah, Professor2017 Researcher of the Year, Distinguished - Basic Life Sciences 

 “I’m a lipid biochemist,” said Papasani Subbaiah, professor of medicine in the department of diabetes/endocrinology and metabolism in the UIC College of Medicine.
Subbaiah’s career has focused on analyzing the role of lipids — the molecules that make up fat in the body — for more than 40 years. His contributions have added to knowledge in several fields including Alzheimer’s disease and other neuroinflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis and metabolism. 









Terry Moore, Assistant Professor 2017 Researcher of the Year, Rising Star - Basic Life Sciences 

 Terry Moore is a medicinal chemist focused on discovering new drugs to improve the lives of men and women living with chronic health conditions, like cancer and diabetes.
Unlike many drug discovery labs, Moore’s lab investigates the way that proteins interact with one another in diseases.
