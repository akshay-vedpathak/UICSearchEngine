Executive Director's Welcome
Welcome to all international students, scholars  and their families. The Office   of International Services (OIS) staff  hopes that you will find your academic   pursuits to be very rewarding  at the University of Illinois at Chicago and that   you use the  resources of our office whenever necessary to assist you in resolving    your immigration related problems and concerns or to enhance your  experience.   The OIS web site was designed to describe the various  programs and services   we offer.
The mission of our office is to enhance and support the international  dimensions   of the University of Illinois at Chicago and the medical  branches in Peoria   and Rockford. This includes participation in the  creation of both a culturally   diverse learning and working environment  by assisting individuals involved in   international educational  exchange. OIS provides an array of essential services   and programs to  assist international students, faculty and scholars, and their    families to achieve their educational, professional and personal  objectives.   To accomplish the mission of enhancing and supporting the  University’s   international efforts OIS:

Provides immigration rules and regulations counseling and advising to international     students, faculty, staff and scholars.
Facilitates the transition of international students, faculty,  staff and     scholars to life at UIC and the U.S. by providing  continuous services aimed     at assisting in the assimilation process.
Provides immigration rules and regulations guidance and referral to  university     departments and units, particularly in the area of  employment, taxation, admissions,     international exchange programs,  and international program creation.

It is our hope that you find our staff to be accessible and  friendly.  We may be reached by telephone, e-mail or personal  appointment.  In addition, we have  for F-1 students and for J-1 Exchange Visitors (students and scholars) where an  advisor is available to answer your general concerns.  Our office  environment is generally informal and you may feel free to call our  staff by our first names.
No matter how long or short your stay at the University of Illinois  at Chicago,   we wish you the best and encourage you to utilize our  services. We look forward   to working with you.
Sincerely,
James Hammerschmidt, PhD
