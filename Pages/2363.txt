Estimated Expenses 

Below are the estimated expenses for attending UIC. Tuition and fees are based on a course load of 12 credits per semester, and are subject to change without notice. The cost estimate for living expenses covers only minimal essential expenditures. Expenses for clothing, recreation, and incidentals are variable, and the cost of travel outside Chicago is not included. Note, the amounts listed in the 'Total' column represent the minimum amount of funding needed for I-20/DS-2019 issuance.
All new F-1 international students are required to show proof that funds are guaranteed for the first year of study.
All new J-1 international students are required to show proof that funds are guaranteed for the full length of his/her program.
Please ensure that adequate funding will continue to be available from the same or equally dependable sources for subsequent years. You may be asked to show proof of this at your visa interview. This proof can come from several different sources (personal, family, university, business, etc.); however, you must be sure to have supporting documents for each of the sources of funding.
