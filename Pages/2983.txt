I grew up in Sweden, got my M.Sc. in CS at the  in . Wasted a few years on dot-coms, before graduating with a Ph.D. from  in '06. I then spent a two-year postdoc at .  I've been a faculty member of the UIC Department of Computer Science since 2009, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2015.

My wife  is in the ECE department. We live in the near-west suburb of Oak Park together with our two children Matilda and Oskar. 

 Research Interests 

My research interests lie primarily in computer systems, including operating systems, networks and mobile sensing. In operating systems, I work on deterministic execution, high-performance messaging systems, and alternative uses for simultaneous multi-threading. In the mobile and networked systems area, some of my work includes vehicular WiFi connectivity, and mobile sensing for traffic monitoring and road condition assessment. You can read more about my research projects on my .
