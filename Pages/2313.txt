Credential Evaluations 
 Due to a stricter interpretation of the immigration regulations related  to the filing of employment-based non-immigrant and immigrant benefits  by the immigration service, internationals are required to submit  foreign education credential evaluations. This evaluation should be  submitted to OIS along with the respective request form and all other  supporting documents. The handling of the evaluation request may be  completed by either the UIC sponsoring department or the international  employee. OIS will not be involved in the evaluation process.




 

Evaluation Requirements


When requesting an evaluation the type of evaluation needed is a  “General” or “Document-by-Document” Report. This type of evaluation will  provide degree equivalencies. Course-by-course evaluations are NOT  needed.
Please state that the evaluation is for “Immigration” and NOT  “Employment”. Indicating the evaluation purpose is for “Immigration”  will include the requisite signature and information about the company.
