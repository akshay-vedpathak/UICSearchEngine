UIC Day of Service
The UIC Day of Service is UIC's largest service event, and takes place annually in April. With partners from multiple sites and community organizations across Chicagoland, the day brings together the entire UIC community to give back to Chicago.
In April 2018, more than 140 UIC students, alumni, employees and others dedicated over 400 hours to giving back to Chicago-area communities during the ninth annual UIC Day of Service. Participants volunteered at 20 sites that served 17 nonprofits. To read more, visit .
In 2019, we're excited to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the UIC Day of Service. Join us on April 13, 2019!
Registration and site details will be available at  in early March.
