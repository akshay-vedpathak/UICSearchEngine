Medical Immunization Requirements

 








The Illinois Department of Public Health requires that all students living in on-campus housing and who were born on or after January 1, 1957, must present documented proof of immunity against Measles (Rubeola), Rubella (German Measles), Mumps, TD (Tetanus and Diphtheria) as a prerequisite to registration. The Medical Immunization Form, required for student completion, is mailed with the student’s acceptance letter from the Admissions Office (Admissions and Records).
Those students who are not properly immunized and have not submitted a written statement of medical or religious exemption must be immunized within the first term of enrollment. Failure to provide the required proof of immunity will prevent the student from enrolling in a subsequent term.
For complete information, including a pdf of the proof of immunity and link for students to check their medical immunization records online, see the  website.  The office is located in Room 1300, Student Services Building (SSB), telephone (312) 413-0464.
