Rafael Cintrón Ortiz Latino Cultural Center
remember the past, reflect on the present, envision a future











Welcome!
There is a saying in Spanish, con el corazón en mano (with the heart in hand), which implies that someone is coming to you or welcoming you with honest and peaceful intentions. The Rafael Cintrón Ortiz Latino Cultural Center at UIC does just that for Latinxs and anyone who wishes to expand their knowledge about the cultural heritage of Latinx communities and advocate for social and environmental justice.
