Childcare & Schooling
Children in the U.S. are required to attend school from age 6 to 16. There are    and private schools in every neighborhood. The school year begins in   late August and ends in May or June. You will want to find out before   the school year starts what you will need to do to register and enroll   your child in school. Many schools have kindergarten for children who   are 5 years old. For children 3-6 years of age, the  is available at the University for a fee. Because space is limited, you are encouraged to apply in advance.

Climate

Chicago is characterized by four distinct  seasons. The flat terrain  of the Midwest combined with Lake Michigan  make Chicago’s weather  unpredictable and frequently extreme. Summer is  very warm and often  humid. The hottest temperatures occur throughout  July and August and  can reach a high of 95 – 100 degrees Fahrenheit (35 –  37 Centigrade). The coldest days are usually in January and February  when the  temperature can drop below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees   Centigrade). Snow and strong winds characterize a Chicago winter. Fall   and Spring weather can be rainy and changeable but typically include   many sunny and moderate days. You will need appropriate clothes for   these distinct seasons (i.e. coats, boots, hats, gloves, etc.).
Chicago Winter Survival Guide: read below for winter tips and fun suggestions.
Clothing:
Typical winter clothes include: a heavy winter jacket/coat,   gloves/mittens, a scarf, a hat or earmuffs, thick socks (typically   wool), long underwear, and snow boots. Temperature varies in Chicago on a   day by day basis. The best advice is to check weather conditions and  be  prepared.
Public Transportation:
Public transportation can be slower in the winter months due to snow,   ice, or sleet. Be aware of this if you are taking public transportation   so you can plan accordingly. You can check the Chicago Transit   Authority (CTA) bus schedule anytime of the year on the CTA’s website: .
Driving:
Driving can be challenging during the winter months. Always keep an ice   scraper and brush in your car during the winter months. Jumper cables   are another essential item (at any time of the year) to have with you at   all times in your car.
Biking:
If you plan on biking during the winter months, we recommend checking   weather conditions before doing so. It can be very challenging to bike   during the winter months in Chicago because of the very cold   temperatures, as well as ice and snow on the ground. Be careful.
Ice:
Be careful of ice! There is something called black ice which is not   actually black, but transparent. It is very difficult to see because it   takes on the color of the surface beneath it. The most common places to   find black ice are asphalt and concrete.
Things to do in Chicago during the winter:

Of course, you can always head inside to stay warm. Chicago has   plenty of museums that have free or discounted days. You can check each   museum’s website to see hours of operation, special exhibits, and   discount days. Here are a few Chicago has to offer:











Cultural Adjustment
Although being in a new country with new opportunities can be very   exciting, at times it will be hard to adjust to a completely foreign   culture, language, and lifestyle.
The adjustment cycle is continuous. You may move from one stage to another   and then back again – this is normal. We have identified some ways in   which you can help to cope with homesickness and make your experience   the best that it can be! 
 

Stages of Cultural Adjustment


Honeymoon   Stage: The   first stage is marked by exhilaration, anticipation and   excitement. You are beginning your   dream of working or studying in the U.S. and   feel cooperative, quick to   please, and take an active interest in the   lives of others. Because you are eager to please,   misunderstandings   may occur when you want to understand but do not. When the  frustration  of misunderstandings   start to add up, you may move to the  next stage…


Hostility   Stage:  The  next stage is distinguished   by irritation, anger, anxiety, and   sometimes depression, loss of appetite,   disruptive sleep patterns or   indigestion. You may feel frustrated because you have studied   English, but you cannot   seem to understand people. You may   become   hostile towards your environment and U.S. culture in general. You may   get highly irritated over minor   frustrations, become very untrusting   and even fearful of Americans. It is here that academic problems arise     along with a lack of motivation, and at worst, complete isolation.


Humor   Stage: The  third  stage takes place   when you notice yourself relaxing into new   situations and laughing at   misunderstandings which, in the hostility   stage, would have caused major   frustration. At this point you will     have learned how to manage the ins and outs of the University system  and  will   have made friend and acquaintances. 


Home Stage: The  final  stage occurs when you not only feel a sense of   unity with your  home  culture, but also “feel at home” here in the U.S. It is time to   congratulate yourself, as you   have successfully adjusted to life at a   University and have discovered how to   live successfully in two   cultures!

Food
There are many grocery stores through the Chicago-land area, reflecting the truly    that make up the city. Two major grocery stores are Jewel and   Mariano’s. Both stores have a preferred card plan for regular   customers, providing them with discounts on certain items. Treasure   Island Foods, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and Wild Oats offer more organic   products.
 
You should be able to meet all of your dietary needs in Chicago’s   diverse city. You do not need to bring special food items from your   home country. Chicago is a city of ethnic neighborhoods and you can find   grocery stores for African, , Caribbean, European, , Indian, Italian, Korean, Latin American, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Russian, Thai, and Vietnamese products. You can find grocery stores near you, by entering your zip code and city.

Religion
The United States has a long tradition of religious and spiritual   tolerance. Because so many ethnic groups have passed through, over time   Chicago has accumulated a rich diversity of religions. Please visit  to find your preferred place of worship.

Get Involved
An excellent way to get to know people with your similar interests is to join a club or organization. Please refer to  for a complete listing of all student organizations.
You can also visit the Office of International Service’s Activities Calendar, or consider joining the International Club.
