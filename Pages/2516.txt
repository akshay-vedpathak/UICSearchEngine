Graduate College Fellowship and Award Deadlines

 








Deadlines for UIC fellowships and other awards administered through the Graduate College are established jointly by the Awards Committee of the Graduate College and the Graduate College.  Since departments need to submit nominations to the Graduate College (wherever it states "department nominations due") students should consult with their programs to determine by when documents must be submitted to the program. 
Please note: We are in the process of modifying these fellowships and awards, e.g., name changes and slight tweaks to forms. Processes and deadlines will be similar to AY17-18. Thank you for your patience.
