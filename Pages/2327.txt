Thanksgiving Dinner
Thanksgiving, a traditional U.S.
holiday, is typically celebrated with family and friends. In an effort to give
international students and their families an opportunity to experience this
unique American holiday, OIS hosts its annual Thanksgiving Dinner every
November. Students in attendance are able to enjoy traditional Thanksgiving
food and hospitality on campus while learning about the origin of the holiday
and its significance in American culture.
