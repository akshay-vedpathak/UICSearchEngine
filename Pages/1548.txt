The  is recognized for its academic excellence with undergraduate and graduate programs in the six academic departments: Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil and Materials Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechanical and Industrial Engineering.
We are continually improving undergraduate and graduate instructional activities and support programs and advancing our research facilities and laboratories. I invite you to visit our department and program websites to meet our fine faculty, learn about our academic and support programs and explore the range of cutting-edge engineering research at the UIC College of Engineering.
