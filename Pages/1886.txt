The AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) chapter at the University of Illinois at Chicago is a student run organization located in Region III. It is primarily dedicated to the study of aerospace and propulsion engineering.  The club was formed in 2011 because the University of Illinois at Chicago does not currently have an aerospace engineering major for undergraduate students.

We design and build remote controlled aircraft’s, high powered rockets, and quad-copters.


We compete in the AIAA Design Build Fly competition, Battle of the Rockets, and the Midwestern Robotics Design Competition.
