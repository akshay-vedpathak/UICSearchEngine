Money/BankingCurrency

ATM:
Using an ATM card is a common way to withdraw  money in the U.S. ATM  machines are very common. ATM stands for  Automatic Teller Machine, and  is a machine that allows you to withdraw  cash from your bank account,  without having to be at your bank. Be  aware that most banks will  charge a fee if you use ATMs of another bank  on their machine. This can  add up quickly – so be careful!  
 
Credit Card:
It is also common for people to pay for items by credit  card. Visa,  MasterCard and American Express cards are usually accepted  in most  grocery stores, retail shops and restaurants.  
 
Exchanging Currency: 
Most money can be exchanged at major banks and at most . In addition to exchanging currency, this store provides other  services,  such as sending money through Western Union, and providing  for purchase.
The following information may be helpful to those unfamiliar with   United States currency: One dollar ($1.00) equals “100” cents. Paper   money or “bills”, come in denominations of $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and   $100. Coins are in denominations as follows:
