GrACE














 The Graduate Association of Chemical Engineering (GrACE) was founded in January of 1987. The goals of this organization were formulated by the graduate students and can be divided into three major categories. 
In order to create and maintain a warm and friendly atmosphere in the department, GrACE plans frequent social and athletic events such as parties and tournaments
 
Second, in an effort to enhance communication and information sharing among various research groups in the department, GrACE will organize informal research presentations
 
GrACE is the voice of our graduate students in the department and will protect their interests in all matters
 Since its establishment, GrACE has been able to win the enthusiastic support of both the graduate students and faculty and has now become an integral part of the chemical engineering department. The graduate students consider GrACE as a major factor in making their stay in this department a more fruitful and fulfilling experience.
