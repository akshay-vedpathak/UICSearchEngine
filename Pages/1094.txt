Ignite: Exploring Leaders Program
Ignite is an eight-week program that supports first- and second-year undergraduate students as they begin to navigate and explore the concepts of leadership and self-reflection. Meeting once a week with peer facilitators and mentors, Ignite participants gain access to valuable campus resources, along with gaining insight into the values, support, and competencies needed for positive involvement at UIC. Using a passion-driven action plan, students distinguish key identities, values, and issues that matter to them. Upon completion of the program, students will feel better connected with the UIC community, feel more in touch with their personal goals, and become a change agent for the future.

“Ignite solidified that leadership qualities can be evoked from almost anyone when given the confidence and appropriate opportunities to do so. Mentoring through Ignite gave me a sense of purpose on campus, ended my hiatus from leadership, and connected me with inspiring individuals.”

“Because I was an immigrant and struggled through college, I chose to help students in similar situations so they could have a better experience than I had.”

“While my passion lies in the fields of medicine and mathematics, I give back through this Ignite leadership role by sharing what I’ve learned about building leadership skills, time management, project development, and other transferable skills.”

“I want to give back to students because I never had guidance when I began college. I believe my leadership role can be effective because I am helping the students I work with discover their own passions, goals and values.”
