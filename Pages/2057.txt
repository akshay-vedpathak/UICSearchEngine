Ewa, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and Nguyen, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences, will aboard a polar vessel for three weeks from August 23 to September 13 and will learn about polar science and climate change, while conducting Arctic field research with ocean scientists.
