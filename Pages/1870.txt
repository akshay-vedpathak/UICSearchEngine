					CME Department Rises in U.S. News and World Report Rankings

CME Department Rises in U.S. News and World Report Rankings






 
 


The Department of Civil and Materials Engineering at UIC has moved up in the latest U.S. News and World Report rankings of graduate Civil Engineering programs. CME moved up substantially in the rankings to 62nd overall, which is the 39th percentile. The new ranking shows CME racing 29 spots higher than its 2014 ranking. 
“The hard work and dedication of the faculty is what helped us progressively move up in the USNWR Civil Engineering rankings as our raw score improved from 2.1 to 2.5,” said Karl Rockne, Interim Department Head and Professor. “With two NSF CAREER award winners in the department this year and continued great productivity from our faculty, I am confident our reputation will continue to grow.”
The latest ranking has UIC tied with Civil Engineering programs at Auburn, Michigan Tech, Louisiana State, University of Nebraska, Oklahoma and the University of Tennessee. Each school’s score reflects its average rating on a scale from 1 (marginal) to 5 (outstanding), based on a survey of academics at peer institutions.
