The UIC Institute for the Humanities encourages interdisciplinary research and intellectual exchange by sponsoring a variety of faculty working groups each year. The format for working groups is flexible and is determined by the faculty coordinators who must represent at least two departments. The Institute supports working groups by circulating materials, funding outside speakers, publicizing events, and providing modest refreshments for meeting and lectures.











As the hub of humanities scholarship on campus, the Institute for the Humanities supports a wide range of public lectures, invitational workshops, Flash Conferences, and engaged humanities activities for faculty, students, and the community at large.
















Faculty Fellows make visible the interdisciplinary community at the University of Illinois at Chicago. While in residence at the Institute, the fellows participate in workshops and deliver public lectures on their research.

















Each year the Institute for the Humanities brings a scholar to the UIC community whose innovative work has played a crucial role in reconceptualizing the disciplines of the humanities. This Visiting Fellow presents a public lecture and leads a seminar for faculty and advanced graduate students.
