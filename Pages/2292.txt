Acceptable Proof of Financial Support
We must have appropriate proof of financial support before we issue the DS-2019. You are permitted to show funding from a single source or from a combination of courses to meet the minimum required amount. Sources of funding may include:

UIC Invitation Letter. Your invitation letter will show your exchange activities while at UIC, UIC funding, and dates of stay at UIC.


Personal or Family Funds. If you will be funded by personal or family funds, present original/official bank statements or bank letters showing personal savings sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements. These documents must state a specific amount of funds available to you and must be issued within the past six months. If the documents you submit are in a family member's name (e.g. a parent, guardian, spouse, etc.), then they must be accompanied by an original statement from that person confirming the following:



the relationship of that person to you,
the intent of that person to your sponsor to stay in the U.S.,
the amount and currency,
the duration of their support, and
if they are currently in the U.S., their citizenship and U.S. immigration status.



Government, Foreign Employer, and Other Non-UIC Organizational Funding. Present an original/official letter on letterhead from the funding source (e.g. employer, funding organization, university, etc.) confirming the following four items:



the total amount of funding to be provided to you (specify the amount and currency),
the dates during which funding will be provided,
the signature of a person in the organization who is authorized to guarantee those funds, and
the University of Illinois at Chicago must be listed as the scholar's destination.

All documents not in English must be accompanied by an official, verbatim, English translation.
