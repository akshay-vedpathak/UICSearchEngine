					Undergraduate Studies				




Undergraduate Studies











Civil engineering is a broadly based discipline that encompasses many specialties. The civil engineering curriculum provides students with a strong background in engineering and applied sciences that prepares graduates for professional licensure.
The Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) at UIC is accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), a necessary requirement for obtaining the Professional Engineering (PE) license. The program educational objectives and student outcomes for the BSCE degree program at UIC were approved by the Departmental faculty, Civil Engineering Professional Advisory Council (), and student representatives of the Department, and they are detailed under  page.
