          Addressbook Conversion        




Email clients, including pine, Webmail, and GoogleApps@UIC, allow you to use addressbooks for those you email most often. Unfortunately, they all use their own formats for these addressbooks, so you can not readily share that information between your email programs if you use more than one. Addressbook Conversion tool (authentication required) allows you to convert addressbooks from one format to another. You can convert to or from any of the following formats:
A comma delimited text file ()
Pine
Webmail
Eudora
The addressbook conversion tool is currently offline.
Please  to convert your Webmail addressbook for Outlook.
