          Campus Email Directory        




LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an Internet protocol that email programs use to look up contact information from a server. The ACCC runs an LDAP server named ldap.uic.edu that you can use to look up the names and email addresses of people using NetID@uic.edu email addresses; you can use it with many email programs and any type of email account to automatically fill in addressees.
Note that the ACCC is currently limiting the number of results per query to ldap.uic.edu to 100 in order to discourage spammers trolling for email addresses. We may adjust this limit if it proves to be problematic.

	Basic configuration
The important information you'll need to set it up to work with most email programs is:

				Field

				Value

				LDAP Server (Host) Name

ldap.uic.edu

				Search Base

ou=people,dc=uic,dc=edu

				Port

389

				Login

				No login or authentication needed (anonymous)

				Maximum number of results to return

100

				Search scope

Subtree or One level

				Search filter

(objectclass=*)
Do not use Secure connection or Encryption.

	Client configuration
