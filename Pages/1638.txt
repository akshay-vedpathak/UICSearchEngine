ABET Accreditation











ABET ACCREDITATION
In 1973, a number of the College’s programs received their first accreditation from the Engineers Council for Professional Development (now ABET).
The Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) degree program at CME has been accredited by the , the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (and its predecessor organizations).
ABET, Inc., the recognized accreditor for college and university programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and technology, is a federation of 28 professional and technical societies representing these fields. Among the most respected accreditation organizations in the U.S., ABET has provided leadership and quality assurance in higher education for more than 80 years.
The Program’s Educational Objectives pertain to the expected accomplishments of our graduates during the first few years after graduation. The Student Outcomes describes the expected knowledge and technical capabilities of our students by the time of graduation.
CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES
Graduates of the Civil Engineering program at the University of Illinois at Chicago will establish careers in engineering, research and development, and/or management professions and be involved in professional societies. Graduates of the program are expected within a few years of graduation:

To apply technical expertise, effective design skills, and sustainability principles to address evolving engineering challenges affecting a diverse society
To be engaged in continuing education. Motivated graduates will have pursued or have well-formulated plans to pursue graduate education
To effectively and ethically contribute as a member, manager, or leader of multidisciplinary teams through efficient communication of technical and nontechnical issues

A majority of those in the engineering profession will be licensed Professional Engineers within five years of graduation, and a majority of those practicing structural engineering will become licensed Structural Engineers within ten years.
CIVIL ENGINEERING STUDENT OUTCOMES
Graduates of the Civil Engineering Program will be able to:

Apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering
Design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data
Design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability
Function on multidisciplinary teams
Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems
Understand professional and ethical responsibility
Communicate effectively
Understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context
Recognize the need for, and an ability to engage in lifelong learning
Understand contemporary issues
Use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice
A majority of the graduates should pass the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam
