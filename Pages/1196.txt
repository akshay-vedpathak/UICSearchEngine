          How do I use the UIC email address book on my Mac?        




Tags: , , , Service: , , If you're connected to a network that is set up to use network directories, the Mac Address Book automatically searches for addresses on the directory servers on the network. You can set your Address Book up to search for address information on LDAP server(s) you specify. This works really great with the UIC LDAP server and it's very easy to set up. (Note that the details depend on the version of Mac OS you are using. The information used to configure UIC LDAP is always the same.)
Open the Address Book.
Click Address Book > Preferences
What comes next varies; some options are:
LDAP > + (OS X) or Add.
Or: Accounts > + > LDAP

Fill out the LDAP configuration box as follows:
Name/Description: UIC LDAP
Server address: ldap.uic.edu
Search Base: ou=people,dc=uic,dc=edu
Leave Port: 389
Scope: One level
Authentication: None

Click Save and close the Preferences window.
After you have LDAP set up with Address Book, open Mail.app and open a new message. Type a name in an address field -- either a last or a first name will do, but unless the first name is very usual, you might not find your person -- and the names and email addresses of people at UIC whose names match what your have typed will be listed.
To select a person from the list, click on his or her name/email address.
