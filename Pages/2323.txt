Global Ambassadors




 

Program Overview

The Global Ambassador volunteer program is an opportunity for students who have been active with the Office of International Services to deepen their connection to the UIC international community, develop leadership skills, and gain community service experience.
Global Ambassadors assist OIS staff during major events such as the annual Thanksgiving Dinner and International Education Week. Their participation in International Student Orientation is especially critical as it provides new international students the opportunity to learn from peers who have come before them. Specific examples of past Global Ambassador activities include:

Guiding campus tours for new international students.
Accompanying new international students on trolley tours of Chicago.
Leading small group discussions on topics such as U.S. culture and academic integrity.
Promoting OIS programs at campus involvement fairs.
Providing feedback to OIS on issues related to the international student experience at UIC and in Chicago.

Recruitment for the Global Ambassador volunteer program typically occurs prior to the fall, spring, and summer academic terms. Positions are limited and students with a demonstrated commitment to the UIC international community are especially encouraged to submit an interest form.
