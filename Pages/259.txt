At one end of the spectrum, computer science may be viewed as the formal study of what can be computed and what resources are required for computation.  At the other end of the spectrum, computer science may be seen as the application of human resources, software and of course, computers to solve computational problems relating to society's and individuals' needs.A well-trained computer scientist requires a knowledge of both ends of this spectrum--and several points in between.  The Computer Science curriculum in the Department of Computer Science is intended to provide that broad background.  Along with a strong theoretical component, our program places special emphasis on the development of applied skills in design, implementation and validation of computer systems.  In our experience, industry and graduate programs alike value--above all--people who can solve real problems, and who come prepared to use the tools of their trade.All students acquire a common background in the fundamental areas of computer science: computer systems, organization and architecture, algorithms and data structures, principles of software design, elements of the theory of computation, and operating systems.  In addition, students obtain specialized backgrounds through the selection of five technical elective courses in Computer Science.  Required and elective courses in the sciences and mathematics, along with additional courses in writing, humanities, social sciences and the arts give students the opportunity to expand their horizons and to prepare for multi disciplinary careers.There are very few areas in modern society untouched by Computer Science.  Computer science is present in everything from health care, telecommunications and entertainment, to transportation, education and defense. The result of this diversity is that a computer scientist must be capable of working with people outside his or her field.  In support of this, the Computer Science program provides its students with a well-rounded education requiring significant course work outside the Department of Computer Science, placing a strong emphasis on writing and communication skills.Getting StartedConcentration AreasComputer System ConcentrationThe Computer Systems Concentration represents a sub-specialty that provides more emphasis on understanding and designing computer hardware.  The student continues to learn the fundamental areas of computer science: programming, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, formal languages, architecture and operating systems.  Unlike traditional computer science, however, the student also studies low-level circuit analysis and high-level system design, and has the option to take additional hardware-oriented courses.  The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering.Software Engineering ConcentrationThe Software Engineering Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in software engineering.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science, including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems.  In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of software engineering practice such as software cost estimation, large-scale software development, and risk management.Human-Centered Computing ConcentrationThe Human-Centered Computing Concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in areas such as: user-interface design and development for desktop or mobile devices; computer graphics and animation for video games, movie special effects; and scientific-, engineering- and medical visualization.  The concentration continues to cover in depth the fundamental areas of computer science including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems. In addition the concentration focuses on key topics of human-centered computing practice such as user-interface design, computer graphics, visual media, and natural language processing.Undergraduate Curricula are available in the UIC Catalog.Summary of CS Degree requirements and details are presented in different formats below to understand the requirements better:.  – Overview of Prerequisites for all CS courses for Completing CS Science Requirement - for students to plan & personalize their own graduation plan Required & Selective CourseworkRequired & Selective CS CoursesThe following table shows if a CS course is Required (R) or Selective (S) for the Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Science, and each of the 3 concentration areas:CSO – the Computer Systems ConcentrationHCC – the Human-Centered Computing ConcentrationSE – the Software Engineering Concentration.Course descriptions and official program requirements can be viewed on the . 100 level coursesBSCSOHCCSECS 100Discovering Computer Science––––CS 107Introduction to Computing and Programming––––CS 109C/C++ Programming for Engineers with MatLab––––CS 111Program Design IRRRRCS 141Program Design IIRRRRCS 151Mathematical Foundations of ComputingRRRR200 level coursesBSCSOHCCSECS 211Programming PracticumRRRRCS 251Data StructuresRRRRCS 261Machine OrganizationRRRR300 level coursesBSCSOHCCSECS 301Languages and AutomataRRRRCS 341Programming Language Design and ImplementationRRRRCS 342Software DesignRRRRCS 361Computer SystemsRRRRCS 362Computer DesignRRRRCS 377Communication and Ethical Issues in ComputingRRRRCS 385Operating Systems Concepts and DesignRRRRCS 398Undergraduate Design/Research––––400 level coursesBSCSOHCCSECS 401Computer Algorithms IRRRRCS 411Artificial Intelligence I––S–CS 412Introduction to Machine Learning––––CS 415Computer Vision I––S–CS 421Natural Language Processing––S–CS 422User Interface Design and Programming––RSCS 424Visualization and Visual Analytics––S–CS 425Computer Graphics I––S–CS 426Video Game Design and Development––S–CS 440Introduction to Software Engineering–––RCS 441Engineering Distributed Objects For Cloud Computing–––SCS 442Software Engineering II–––RCS 450Introduction to Networking–S––CS 455Design and Implementation of Network Protocols––––CS 466Advanced Computer Architecture–S––CS 469Computer Systems Design–S––CS 473Compiler Design–S––CS 474Object-Oriented Languages and Environments–––SCS 476Programming Language Design––––CS 477Public Policy, Legal, and Ethical Issues in Computing, Privacy, and Security––––CS 478Software Development for Mobile Platforms––––CS 480Database Systems–––SCS 485Networked Operating Systems Programming––––CS 486Secure Operating System Design and Implementation––––CS 487Building Trustworthy Computing Systems–S––CS 489Human Augmentics––––CS 491Seminar––––CS 493Special Problems––––Undergraduate Tutoring ProgramThe CS department offers peer tutoring services focused on 100, 200 and 300 level classes. 
Current list of tutors and the tutoring schedule is available on our .Tutoring is available from 10AM-9PM Monday-Friday in 2250 SELE.Refer to the link above for availability of specific class levels. No appointment necessary.Undergraduate AdvisingAll College of Engineering undergraduate students are required to be advised before they are able to register for classes each semester, 'advising hold' will not be removed until you are advised.  In Fall and Spring you will receive email from the department or your advisor about advising sign-up and advising appointments.  You should complete this before registration becomes available in the 11th week.Find your advisor from the .
