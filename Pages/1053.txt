        Approved by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees in November of 2018, the UIC Master Plan Update: 2018 Implementation Plan is a
        bold vision for changing the physical infrastructure of the UIC campus in a way that will enable the continued trajectory
        of UIC’s people and programs.  The 2018 Implementation Plan is an update to the 2010 UIC Campus Master Plan, providing data-driven
        and inspirational recommendations for the physical development of UIC’s campus over the next ten years. The 2010 Plan was a developed
        as a long-term, comprehensive framework that provided recommendations for buildings, grounds, transportation and identity over
        a 50-year planning horizon.  Building upon the 2010 Plan as a foundation, the 2018 Implementation Plan also implements the
        University’s Strategic Priorities, which were developed in 2016 as a way for the University build on its strengths and mission.
        The recommendations of the 2018 Implementation Plan are guided by the four following principles:
        
Drive Excellence: Build appropriate environments to support academic and healthcare programs
Enhance Identity: Create a welcoming setting that encourages people to linger
Our Campus is Chicago: Connect people and the campus to the city
Transform UIC: Leverage campus heritage and change the physical paradigm to appeal to all



        This plan provides thoughtful and strategic recommendations for the construction of new facilities, facility additions and open-space improvements
        that will support UIC’s strategic priorities and drive excellence, enhance UIC’s identity, strengthen the student experience,
        connect the campus with the city of Chicago and create a meaningful sense of place.
