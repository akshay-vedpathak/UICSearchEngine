Wide Variety of Learning Opportunities
Whether you are a freshman at UIC, a baccalaureate degree holder looking for graduate education in public health, a seasoned professional seeking specialized public health training, or simply want to sample the field—the School of Public Health has something to offer.
The only Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) accredited School of Public Health in Illinois, SPH houses a wide variety of degree programs, including both online and onsite options. We also give students the chance to earn a second, related, degree in a shortened period of time through one of our eleven joint or coordinated degree programs.
Thanks to our interdepartmental concentrations students also have opportunities for cross-training in such areas as violence studies, women's health, global health and survey research methodologies.
For those seeking specialized training, the school offers seven academic certificate programs—all in online format. Credit hours students earn by completing certificate courses may transfer into a degree program*. If you are still testing the public health waters, SPH allows you to take up to four courses in credit non-degree status. Finally, non-credit professional training is also available through some of our academic divisions and centers.
*Admission into a degree program is not guaranteed.
