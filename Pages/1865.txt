An Interview with Dr. Vikas Berry











October 3, 2018
CHICAGO -- While some 3D printers are easy to buy and are getting cheaper, that doesn’t mean people will be able to print a gun in their kitchens.











May 9, 2017
The electrochemical performance of three different types of membrane-containing electrolyte-flow schemes for solar-driven water splitting has been studied quantitatively using 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional multi-physics models. The Nernstian potential loss associated with pH gradients at the electrode surfaces, the resistive loss between the cathode and anode, the product-gas crossovers, and the required pumping energy in all three schemes have been evaluated as a function of the operational current density, the flow rates for the electrolyte, and the physical dimensions of the devices.






























 The Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Illinois at Chicago provides students with cutting-edge research opportunities, transformative educational growth and professional development. Watch our latest Chemical Engineering Education video.
