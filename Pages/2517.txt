Acceptance of Offer of Financial Support - April 15

 








The University of Illinois at Chicago follows the national practice of allowing admitted students until April 15 to accept offers of financial support for the upcoming academic year.
Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15.  In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without first obtaining a written release from the institution to which a commitment has been made.  Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer.
Please read the complete Council of Graduate Schools .  Also on that document is a list of instutions that support the resolution.
