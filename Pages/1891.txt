Graduate Studies











 The MS and PhD programs in Bioengineering provide training in the research and development of systems using engineering concepts and methods that apply modern technology to problems of living systems and health care. UIC Bioengineering also participates in the prestigious NIH-supported Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), a competetive MD/PhD program providing 7 years of support for pursuit of MD and PhD degrees in a coordinated seamless experience with the UIC College of Medicine, home of the largest medical school in the country. Visit the MSTP Website for more details.
