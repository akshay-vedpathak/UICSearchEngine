CategoriesThere are several categories of J-1 Exchange Visitors with their own set of program objectives and requirements. Below are detailed explanations of J-1 Exchange Visitor categories commonly seen at UIC. All categories require the participant to demonstrate sufficient English proficiency and to maintain appropriate health insurance for their entire program in the U.S.






 

Research Scholar or Professor

Purpose: This category is designed for Exchange Visitors to conduct research, teach, lecture, observe, or consult at UIC. Research Scholars and Professors must have at least some graduate education and demonstrated experience in his or her field.
Funding: Funding may come from various sources: UIC, personal funds, or outside sources, such as one's home government.
Program Time Limit: Initial stay of at least three weeks up to five years, subject to availability of funding for the stay. Extensions are permitted up to five years provided that funding is available unless the Waiver of the Exchange Visitor Home-Country Physical Presence Requirement [also known as 212(e), if applicable] has been granted.
Restrictions: J-1 status does not allow immigrant intent and is therefore not appropriate for tenure-track positions. The '12-month bar" prohibits an individual from becoming a Research Scholar or Professor for twelve months if he or she was previously in J status for more than six of the previous twelve months in a category other than Short-Term Scholar. The "24-month bar" prohibits an individual from becoming a Research Scholar or Professor for 24 months, if they were previously a Research Scholar or Professor.
Foreign M.D. holders may have incidental patient contact. Other health care professionals (dentists, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, etc.) may not have incidental patient contact. No Research Scholar or Professor may engage in any direct patient care at any time.
 

Short-Term Scholar

Purpose: This category is designed for Exchange Visitors conducting independent research at UIC for less than six months. The research must not be UIC-funded "bench" research.
Funding: Funding may come from various sources: UIC, personal funds, or outside sources, such as one's home government.
Program Time Limit: Six months without the possibility of extension.
Restrictions: Foreign M.D. holders may have incidental patient contact. Other health  care professionals (dentists, nurses, physical therapists, occupational  therapists, etc.) may not have incidental patient contact. No Research  Scholar or Professor may engage in any direct patient care at any time.
 

Student Intern

Purpose: This category is designed for individuals currently enrolled and pursuing a degree at a postsecondary academic institution outside the U.S. The UIC internship must fulfill the educational objectives for his or her degree program.
Funding: Funding may come from various sources: UIC, personal funds, or outside sources, such as one's home government.
Program Time Limit: Initial stay of at least three weeks up to twelve months without possibility of extension beyond one year.
Restrictions: Student Interns must be full-time (defined as 32 hours per week), of which no more than twenty percent may be clerical work. Student Interns can be paid or unpaid.
Health  care professionals (dentists, nurses, physical therapists, occupational  therapists, etc.) may not have incidental patient contact.
