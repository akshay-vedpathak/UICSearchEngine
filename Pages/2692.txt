Current or prospective PhD students of UIC may apply to join the ESP-IGERT program as Fellows or as Associates. Applicants must demonstrate a strong interest in doing research in electronic security and privacy and in taking the classes of our program. Fellowships are typically awarded to PhD students after they complete the first year of the PhD in their home department. However, outstanding PhD students may apply for the fellowship in the first year of their PhD. The application procedures are the same for Associates and Fellows. However, the fellowship may be awarded only to US citizens and permanent residents.Current PhD Students
