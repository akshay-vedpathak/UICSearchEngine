Welcome! 

Congratulations on being admitted to UIC!
We’re excited to have you join the UIC community. We hope the information below helps you with your next steps.
Please also be sure to follow any newly admitted student guidelines provided to you by the program.
 





Intent to Enroll 

The intent to enroll and matriculation process can vary by program, so it is very important to heed any instructions provided to you by the department.
Most applicants admitted to a graduate level degree program are able to declare their intent to enroll (to accept or decline the offer of admission) from the application status page. A couple programs require an enrollment deposit as part of the intent to enroll process. Please refer to the department directly if you have any questions about enrollment deposits.
Some programs, however, do maintain a process outside of the university application system for their admitted applicants to declare their intent to enroll (and submit enrollment deposits, if applicable).
