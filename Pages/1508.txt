Thank you for visiting the Office  of Academic and Enrollment Services (AES) website. We appreciate your interest  in the University of Illinois at Chicago and the work that we do. AES  professionals are dedicated to recruiting, admitting, enrolling, and serving  diverse, well-qualified classes of students.
UIC's institutional statement of  values informs the work that we do. It reads, 

"UIC's vision of a more  egalitarian society requires an unstinting commitment to access, providing the  broadest range of students…with all the benefits of a great public research  university. At UIC the value of access is distinguished by the precept of  'Access to Excellence,' serving as the central guiding principle for higher  education at UIC.... It follows then, that, for UIC, excellence is not a goal  but a value that informs our every practice. Students must display uncommon  excellence, achieved not only through formal academic measures but also through  life experiences that give them the passion to succeed at UIC."

Like UIC students, we embrace the challenges of higher education and enjoy discovering new ways to meet them.
        Please  if we can be of assistance.
Sincerely,
Kevin M. BrowneVice Provost for Academic and Enrollment Services
