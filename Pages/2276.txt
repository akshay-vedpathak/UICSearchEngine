J-1 Student Employment
On-Campus Employment:
J-1 students must obtain authorization from their program sponsor to
engage in up to 20 hours per week of on-campus employment. Once
authorized, UIC employment cannot exceed 20 hours per week while school
is in session; this amount includes all other authorized employment. J-1 students may work more than 20 hours per week during official university breaks only (Winter Break, Summer).
J-1 students are required to report all on-campus employment to the
Office of International Services in 12 month increments. If you are a
J-1 student and work on-campus, submit a copy of your job offer letter
that includes start and end dates to the Office of International
Services.
On campus employment does not need to be related to the student’s field of study.
Note: Graduate Assistantships correspond to a percentage of hours to be worked each week:

50% = 20 hours per week
33% = 14-15 hours per week
25% = 10 hours per week

Off-Campus Employment:
J-1 students are eligible for off-campus employment in the form of
Academic Training. Academic Training authorization can be issued by OIS
if the student has been maintaining their status and if they meet other
eligibility requirements.
Academic Training
Academic Training is work authorization for students on a J-1 status.
This training is authorized by the J-1 program sponsor and does not
require further authorization from USCIS or the Department of State.
Academic Training may be available during the academic program and/or
upon the completion of the student's program. The following eligibility
requirements must be met:

The primary purpose in the United States must be to study rather than Academic Training
Be in good academic standing and maintaining J-1 student status
The proposed employment is directly related to the major field of study
During Academic Training, maintain J-1 student status and apply for extensions when necessary
Maintain health insurance coverage for the J-1 and any J-2 dependents during the Academic Training period

General limitations of Academic Training:

Employment may be authorized for the length of time necessary to
    complete the goals and objectives of the training. The amount of time
    must be approved in advance by both the academic advisor and OIS.
    Employment may not exceed the period it took to complete the program or
    18 months, whichever is shorter. However, for those earning a Ph.D.,
    post-doctoral training may be authorized for up to 36 months. See an OIS
    advisor to discuss details.
Part-time employment for Academic Training counts towards the 18 or 36 month limit.
Must begin the training within the 30 day grace period of the completion date.

How to Apply:
Download the Academic Training .
Once a student obtains all required documents, they must meet with an
OIS advisor. A student must apply for academic training before the end
date on the DS-2019. Academic Training cannot be authorized after the
end date on the DS-2019.
Upon approval of the request by OIS, the student will receive an
authorization letter and a new DS-2019. The student may not begin
employment until they have received your new DS-2019 and the
authorization date has been reached.
