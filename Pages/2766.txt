Description


F-1 students
interested in applying for Optional
Practical Training (OPT) are required to attend an introductory
OPT Workshop. The OPT workshop covers essential information about the benefit
such as eligibility requirements, application process, and timeline. Students
will leave with an understanding of how and when to apply for OPT along with
the necessary application materials. Students may attend an OPT Workshop
whenever the interest sets in, however, it is recommended to attend during the
first weeks of the final semester of study.
This workshop is open
to current UIC international students on an F-1 visa. Registration for the
workshop is not required but students must arrive to the workshop on-time in
order to ensure participation. Workshops begin promptly and late arrivals
cannot be accommodated.
