xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?USCIS to Begin Using More Secure Mail Delivery ServiceBeginning April 30, 2018, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will begin phasing in use of the U.S. Postal Service’s Signature Confirmation Restricted Delivery Service to mail secure documents such as Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and Permanent Resident Cards (Green Cards). 
The new delivery method will require applicants to present identification to sign for their documents upon delivery or designate an agent to sign on their behalf. Applicants will also have the option to sign up for delivery status notifications or to hold their document for pickup at a U.S. post office. 
This change in delivery method will roll out gradually, beginning with documents that need to be re-mailed because they have been returned as non-deliverable. Eventually the new delivery method will expand to all secured documents in the future.
More information about this change to USICS document delivery services can be found on the USCIS .
