 »  »  » Introduction to Laboratory Safety TrainingIntroduction to Laboratory Safety Training

The Introduction to Laboratory Safety Course is a live (in-classroom) training course for all UIC laboratory employees that work inside a laboratory. This is a one-time requirement to be followed by an annual online refresher course. These courses are open to graduate students, post-docs, CHOs, staff, academic professionals, and civil-servants that work inside a laboratory.
Online safety courses do not meet the University’s mandatory requirements for an Introduction to Laboratory Safety Course as they are only designed to be a refresher course after you have completed the in-classroom training.
To better meet your specific research needs, The Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHSO) is offering various lab safety courses that focus on chemical and biological research.
Materials needed on day of training: University iCard, pen/pencil and note pad.
Continental Breakfast will be provided
