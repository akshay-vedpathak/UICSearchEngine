What is the Oral Certification Interview (OCI)?
The Oral Certification Interview (OCI) is a one on one conversation between the student and a member of the ITA staff. A variety of different questions will be asked in order to determine what the student is able to do with the English language and how they communicate in variety of different tasks.
The student should come to the interview prepared to have a normal conversation. However, if the interviewer feels the need for additional information concerning the student’s communicative capabilities, the student may be asked to do an impromptu 3-5 minute teaching demonstration on a topic in their field.  Bear in mind, though, the OCI is not a test of the student’s topical knowledge or to determine how good of a TA they will be, only to determine how well they are able to communicate in English.
