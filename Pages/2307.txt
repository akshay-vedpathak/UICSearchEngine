Guide to Inviting International Visitors: B-1, B-2













General Guidelines for All Visitor statuses:
There are four variations for visitor status in the U.S., B-1, B-2,   WB, and WT. Though each of the four vary slightly, the main intention of   a visitor is to enter the U.S. to vacation, visit friends and family,   observe procedures, attend conferences, etc.; all activities that are   not intended to benefit UIC.
A visitor may not participate in any activity that could   constitute work, whether paid or unpaid. As a general rule: If a U.S.   worker could be paid for the activity/work, then the visitor should not   be coming in a visitor status, but rather in a status that does allow   for employment/payment. Please consult with OIS about such matters   and/or refer to our  that explains the basics of common nonimmigrant statuses.
All international visitors who will be at UIC for more than a one   week visit should report to our office for record-keeping purposes. We   will ask to make copies of their immigration documents and for them to   provide their contact information while visiting UIC.
Visitor Category Basics:
 
B-1 = Visitor for business:
Standard User:

Meet with business associates
Participate in scientific, educational, professional, or business conventions, conferences, or seminars
Undertake independent research
Participate in a medical clerkship

Points to Consider:

Admitted for the period of time necessary to accomplish the business purpose, not to exceed one year
Reimbursement of incidental expenses only
May receive “academic honoraria” payment
Permitted to request an extension or change status

B-2 = Visitor for pleasure:
Standard User:

Tourism, visit relatives or friends
Medical reasons
Participate in conventions or conferences of fraternal, social, or service organization
“Prospective student”

Points to Consider:

May not conduct independent research – use B-1!
Reimbursements of incidental expenses only
May receive “academic honoraria” payment

WB/WT = Visa Waiver Program:
If the visitor is from one of the participating countries of the Visa Waiver Program, please refer to our .    Waiver countries include most of Western Europe, Australia, Japan and a   few others.  The advantage of this status is that the person will be   able to enter without needing to apply for a visa.  The disadvantage is   that the maximum stay is for 90 days without the possibility for   extension.
Procedures to invite a B-1:
Before inviting an international visitor, the department must verify   that all requirements have been met for the B-1 visa category.  In  order  to facilitate this process, the department should: 1) review the ,   which is available for download on the OIS website; and 2) consult  with  OIS to ensure all necessary documentation is collected and/or  drafted.
Departmental Requirements:

The international visitor is limited to a temporary stay of 90 days or less without extension.
The purpose of the visit is solely for temporary commercial,   business, or professional activities, such as attendance at conventions   or conferences, or for professional consultation and observation of a   specific and defined nature.  The purpose of the visit should be   documented in a B-1 Invitation Letter (see  for a template).
The international visitor cannot be paid by the department or  UIC,  but may be reimbursed for nominal costs related to travel expenses   and/or accommodations.  Honoraria payments may be considered if the   visit to UIC is not longer than nine days, and the visitor has not   accepted honoraria from more than five institutions or organizations   within a six-month period.
The international visitor may not be given a formal academic appointment at UIC.
The international visitor may not have any direct or indirect patient contact, or interact with research subjects in any manner.
The international visitor may not attempt to obtain employment   within the U.S., or attempt to change their status to J-1 or H-1B.
The international may not volunteer or take part in departmental operation decisions, or be given an appointment at UIC.
The international visitor may not conduct research using   departmental equipment or resources unless there is direct supervision   by the sponsor.
The international visitor may not displace U.S. workers in any way.

International Visitor Requirements:

The international visitor must have an institutional affiliation in his/her home country or country of permanent residence.
The international must have adequate finances and health  insurance  to support himself/herself for their duration of stay in the  U.S.
The international visitor must abide by the intent of his/her visit throughout their stay in the U.S.

 
Reimbursements and Activity Limitations:
Entry in B-1 status allows the host to reimburse the international   for expenses.  Payment for services is allowed provided that the payment   is for academic activities that last no longer than 9 days and  that  the visitor has not received payments from more than 5  institutions or  organizations in the previous six months.   Please see the Office of Business and Financial Services (OBFS) website and review the “”   section, which is password-protected.  You may also access general   information about Taxes and Foreign Nationals from the main OBFS site,   Taxes,  section.
The OBFS site provides links to additional documents required for   OBFS and Payroll, such as the “Tax Reporting” and “Withholding Checklist   for Foreign National Reimbursements” form.  Completion of these forms   will be necessary before Payroll will allow payment to the individual.   Additionally, the site contains links to ,  ,  ,  , and , , and .
