          How do I export my UICalendar data?        




Tags: , Service: , There isn't a specific tool to transfer all your data from UICalendar to your Google Calendar, but it is easy to get data from UICal into Google Calendar. You can either:
Subscribe Google calendar to your UICal feed for a repeating connection that is read only
Import the data from UICal into Google Calendar. In this case, you have full access to your data, but the import will not repeat automatically.
To generate a subscription link or to download your calendar data is iCalendar (.ics) format, please visit  (authentication required).
