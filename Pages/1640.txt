ABET ACCREDITATION
The UIC Department of Bioengineering was founded in 1965 as one of the five original departments in the College of Engineering. In 1966, the department was awarded one of the first ten Bioengineering Training Grants by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The first undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969, and the first graduate degree in 1972.
The Bioengineering Undergraduate Program has been accredited by the , the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (and its predecessor organizations) since 1976 and was third in the nation to receive ABET accreditation (when ABET came into existence).
