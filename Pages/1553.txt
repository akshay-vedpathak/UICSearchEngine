The UIC College of Engineering Women’s Scholarship Program promotes academic excellence by awarding merit scholarships to first-year, high achieving women, pursuing an engineering or computer science academic career at UIC.  This program consists of several scholarship opportunities, including:
William Unger, UIC alumnus and partner emeritus at the venture capital, Mayfield Fund, meets with the recipients of the William Unger Engineering Scholarship.

SWE-Knowles Scholarship
William Unger Engineering Scholarship
John and Susan Major Scholarship
UIC Engineering Merit Scholarship
and more!

Students who are considered for these scholarships are contacted directly by our WIEP Staff. These students must meet a certain academic criteria and attend a scholarship brunch event on campus for an interview. During this event, students also have an opportunity to meet other prospective students, current engineering students, staff and faculty members, and the Dean of Engineering, Dr. Peter Nelson.
We encourage all students to be active in their scholarship search and to consider external resources for additional opportunities. The following information will help you begin your search and find scholarships that are specific for first-year college students!
