March 18, 2002Professor Florin Balasa has received the NSF CAREER Award: Data-flow Analysis in the Memory Management of Real-Time Multimedia Processing Systems.This research focuses on devising novel techniques based on data-flow analysis in the memory management of real-time multidimensional signal processing. Data-flow analysis is the steering exploration mechanism along this project, allowing more exploration freedom than the traditional scheduling -based investigation, since the memory management tasks usually need only relative (rather than exact) lifetime information. Moreover, data-flow analysis enables the study of memory management tasks at the desired level of granularity -- between whole array and the scalar level -- trading-off computational effort and solution optimality.    March 4, 2002Professor Arye Nehorai was Plenary Speaker at the 6th Biennial Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM01), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, July 2001. He was also Keynote Speaker at the 3rd International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS2001), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, October 2001.
