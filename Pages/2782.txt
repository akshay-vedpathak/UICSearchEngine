Psychiatry and Integrative Medicine




Psychiatry and Integrative Medicine
The Psychiatry and Integrative Medicine services at the UIC Counseling Center offers students the opportunity to be informed about and utilize a combination of safe and effective conventional, complementary, and alternative treatment approaches with the goal of achieving optimal mental health and wellness.  These services emphasize the need to focus on the whole person, and to empower students to have an active role in improving and maintaining their own mental health.




Eligibility and Limitations of Psychiatry and Integrative Medicine Services
Eligibility and Limitations of Psychiatry and Integrative Medicine Services
The UIC Counseling Center offers limited, short-term, psychiatric and integrative medicine (P&IM) services. Typically, only students who are actively engaged in individual therapy at the Counseling Center may be referred for P&IM services at the center. If a client is engaged in therapy at the Counseling Center, their therapist may recommend that they receive a Psychiatric Consultation with a psychiatrist. P&IM services are by appointment only, and no P&IM appointments are offered after hours or on weekends. If a client already has a psychiatrist in the community, but is interested in meeting with a psychiatrist at the Counseling Center, their therapist will review this request with the Counseling Center psychiatrists before scheduling an appointment. Students who are not engaged in therapy at the center, as well as students whose needs exceed the services available at the Counseling Center, are usually directed to seek psychiatric services in the community.
