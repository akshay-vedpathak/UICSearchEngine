Departure
Departing UIC
A  form must be submitted when a student will no longer need the benefits associated with the non-immigrant status that is currently sponsored by UIC.  International students not sponsored by UIC must still submit this form when any of the following situations below apply.
Students should submit the Status Update Form for the following situations:

completion of academic program and will return home
completion of OPT or Academic Training and will return home
change of immigration status

Transfer out of UIC
Students transferring out of the University of Illinois at Chicago to another school in the United States, must complete the  after being admitted to the new school. Prior to submitting the form, the student must choose a release date for their SEVIS record. The release date must occur after the final day of study at UIC and before the student begins studies at the new institution. If the transfer will occur during the term, please consult with an OIS advisor. The student must stop any on-campus employment at UIC by the release date. After the release date has passed, OIS cannot alter the request. Please be sure that the student will be attending the school indicated on this form.
F-1 student: If the student plans on attending another U.S. institution, the new program of study must begin within 5 months of the completion date or end date of OPT.  However, the student must complete the transfer process within the 60 day grace period following the completion of their academic program, English language training or OPT to be transferred in ‘active’ status. After the grace period, your SEVIS record can be transferred in completed status and you will be required to fix your status with your new school.  The student must contact their international student advisor at their new U.S. institution within 15 days of the program start date. Students participating in OPT must cease working upon their release date or when their EAD card expires, whichever comes first.
J-1 student: The student must complete the transfer process within the 30 day grace period of their completion date or after the completion of Academic Training.  After the grace period, the student's DS-2019 can be transferred in completed status and the student will be required to fix their status with their new school. The student must contact their international student advisor at their new U.S. institution within 30 days of the program start date.
