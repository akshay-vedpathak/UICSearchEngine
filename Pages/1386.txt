SAP Policy & Appeal




SAP Policy & Appeal
Federal and state regulations require financial aid recipients to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) towards their degree or certificate. SAP regulations apply to all undergraduate, graduate and professional students who receive federal, state and institutional financial aid administered by the university. After every spring semester, Student Financial Aid and Scholarships (SFAS) reviews all UIC students to verify SAP requirements. SAP status will be reviewed at the conclusion of the fall and summer terms for students enrolled in programs less than two years in length. This review is independent of any conducted by the various academic departments. The Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy review their students’ SAP status annually by their promotion or academic review committees.
