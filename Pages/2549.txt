UIC offers applicants the opportunity to pursue more than one graduate degree at the same time, either through one of our approved joint degree programs, or through concurrent enrollment in more than one UIC program. Approved joint degree programs share a certain number of courses that are used for both degrees. Please note that some joint degree programs do not fall under the auspices of the Graduate College. For the current list of joint degree programs currently offered at UIC, please visit the  Applicants to the MD/PhD program should request a special application from the UIC College of Medicine (312-996-5635) or .
Applicants who wish to apply to more than one degree program must submit a separate application for each department involved, even if applying to an approved joint degree program. Applicants applying to more than one program should indicate on all applications submitted that they intend to pursue more than one degree at a time. Only one application fee per term and only one set of transcripts is required for applicants applying to more than one graduate program.
