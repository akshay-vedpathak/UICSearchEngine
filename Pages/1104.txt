Make Mondays Matter
Taking place the first Monday of each month, in partnership with Commuter and Off-Campus Programs, this regular service opportunity allows students to give back while they are on campus. This enables students who don't have the time or capacity to serve in other ways to still contribute to community organizations. Projects are usually hands on and involve making something. They vary from month to month and have included making fleece-tie blankets for infants of teen parents, assembling welcome kits for hospice patients, creating cards for veterans, making dog toys for shelter animals, and more. Make your Mondays Matter!
