Little Italy / University Village




This is the area that UIC calls home. Lying between the east and west sides of campus and stretching from our north to south, it’s an area that is diverse both ethnically and socioeconomically. Once known as “Hull House neighborhood,” Jane Addams’ original home and the resident’s dining hall still stand as a museum. Other nearby icons include the  and Our Lady of Pompeii church. While University Village bustles with new housing and businesses, Little Italy’s heritage is displayed prominently in the restaurants of Taylor Street.

Pilsen




Located to the south of UIC, Pilsen got its name in the late 19th century from the mostly Czech immigrant population. During the 1960s, there was a large growth in the Latino population in the area and it is now the largest Mexican-American neighborhood in Chicago. The neighborhood celebrates its culture and art with colorful public murals and mosaics, as well as art galleries and museums. The real flavor of the area comes through in the Mexican bakeries, restaurants and groceries that line the active 18th Street corridor.
