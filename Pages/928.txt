Department of Urban Planning and Policy




Welcome to Urban Planning and Policy
In one of the world's great cities, Urban Planning & Policy (UPP) at UIC has led the way in preparing students for careers for over 40 years. Grounded in social equity and sustainability, we teach students to use innovative concepts and technology to address urban issues.
UIC planning students take all classes in Chicago, study in Chicago, and live and breathe in Chicago.  Where better to learn the art of planning great cities than in the city of Daniel Burnham?
