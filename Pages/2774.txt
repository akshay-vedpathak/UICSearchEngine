Services Provided by the UIC Counseling Center



The role of the UIC Counseling Center is to provide brief mental health counseling and related services to help UIC students identify barriers to success, improve coping, and achieve personal goals. Our services are available to eligible students whose concerns fall within our scope of practice.
As a university mental health service, the UIC Counseling Center is equipped to meet many of the unique needs presented by college students. Committed to delivering quality care, the professionals at the UIC Counseling Center provide a range of short-term mental health services to undergraduate and graduate students. Please see our description of services for details.
As with other Counseling Centers across the country, requests for services have consistently increased over the last decade outpacing available resources. In response to the increased demand, we have worked hard to define our scope of practice and recognize that we simply cannot be all things to all people. Those students whose needs cannot be accommodated within our treatment model will be referred to resources outside the Counseling Center for care. Such referrals might occur immediately following the initial assessment of concerns, or they might occur after some treatment and a further assessment of need has taken place.
