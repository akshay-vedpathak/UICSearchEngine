This program allowed Politecnico students to take a semester of UIC course work at the Politecnico, and then finish the MS degree work in residence at UIC for one or more semesters. Each student in the program is required to have a faculty advisor at both institutions, and to defend a master’s thesis at UIC. Since 1999, over 120 EECS/ECE students have graduated from Politecnico di Torino/UIC contract program with a Master of Science degree. Nearly all of the faculty in the ECE department have advised students in the program at one time or another. The program has been a resounding success from both a student and faculty perspective, allowing for research collaborations between institutions, Ph.D. applicants for UIC, and valuable research and corporate work experience in the U.S. for international students.Connect With Us        312.996.6465 Quick LinksInternal LinksMake a Gift  |  © Copyright 2016.
